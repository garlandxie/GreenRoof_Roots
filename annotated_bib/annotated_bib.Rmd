# Green Roofs
[@Lundholm2015:2] Lundholm et al. 2015. Env Sci Tech

- plant functional can be used to streamline plant selection for green roof ecosystems
collected only leaf and canopy traits (e.g. SLA, LDMC, height and leaf area) that are known for driving productivity and resource uptake
- managed to find some links between plant traits and green roof ecosystem services using a model-averaging approach
- some interesting findings were:
  - stormwater capture rate: shrubs had the highest performance, followed by grasses and succulents
  - substrate cooling: large variation among the grasses and shrubs
  - creeping shrubs had the lowest cooling performance
- it appears that succulent monocultures provide the largest benefits for substrate cooling, but a poor performance in terms of stormwater capture.

[@Lundholm2015] Lundholm. 2015. J Appl Ecol
- determine the impacts of green plant species  diversity on multiple ecosystem services
- experimental approach: monocultures, 9 species mixture,  and 15 species mixture
- used quantile regression to see if best-performing polycultures out-performed the best-performing monocultures for multiple services (stormwater capture, cooling, nutrient runoff, ecosystem multifunctionality)
- found that species richness was positively correlated with several services, including ecosystem multifunctionality
- four-year period: an increase in both trait-dependent complementarity and dominance

[@Lundholm2010] Lundholm et al. 2010. PLOS one
- examined if the impact of multiple vegetative life forms outperformed monocultures for several ecosystem services (e..g, stormwater capture, substrate cooling). 
- found that multiple life-forms within a single module had:
  - higher stormwater and substrate cooling than monocultures
  - indicating that a role of sampling effect or niche complementarity
- transpiration and water-uptake are two physiological processes that govern:
  - substrate cooling
  - stormwater retention 
- belowground spatial niche complementarity 
  - partially responsible for the two ecosystem services
  - selected species have variation in their root traits 
  - (e.g. dense and clustered fibrous roots versus rhizomes)
  
[@Lundholm2015] Lundholm. 2015. Front Evo Evo   
- ecological and evolutionary relevance of constructed ecosystems 
  - (e.g., green roofs, constructed wetlands, bioretention filters)
- defines constructed ecosystems “as a set of living and nonliving components”
  - designed to provide valuable services”
- distinctive features that separate constructed ecosystems:
  - (1) relatively simple designs
  - (2) small sizes
  - (3) ecological novelty (lack of historical evolutionary select pressures)
  - (4) the role of human design 
- socioeconomic factors play a role in the design of constructed ecosystems
  - such as the identity of the designer
  - ecologists can learn about community assembly from constructed ecosystems 
  - (e.g. start simple to more complex) 
  - no initial biological legacy to begin with
- evolutionary issues should exist in constructed ecosystem 
  - due to the relatively homogeneous conditions 
  - high levels of ecological novelty

[@Farrell2013] Farell et al. 2013. Plant Soil 
- habitat template approach to find high-water users with drought tolerance
- plant from granite outcrops were chosen as candidate species 
  - xerophytes adapted to limited-water conditions
  - geophytes will lose leaves in unfavourable conditions, but will remain alive
- for optimal performance, green roofs need to restore storage capacity as soon as possible
- tested physiological traits of 12 granite outcrop species in a glasshouse experiment 
- granite outcrop species outperform sedum succulents for stormwater runoff
- monocots and herbs had the highest transpiration rates due to high RMF
- but, mixtures with high drought-resistance and high stormwater performance is key

[@Szota2017] Szota et al. 2017. Sci Total Env
- selecting green roof plants has to balance both drought risk and stormwater retention
- “around 60-80% of rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration in natural ecosystems”
- green roofs should aim to achieve 80% rainfall lost to evapotranspiration
- stormwater retention is caused by different engineering components in the system
  - adding artificial components increase water retention, but adds extra weight 
  - green roof soil tend to have high hydraulic conductivity --> free-draining
- adding retention layers can help, but might be too heavy in some cases
- high water-users can restore storage capacity quickly, but can suffer from drought
  - drought avoiders - “isohydric”: tight stomatal regulation, maintain water status
  - drought-tolerant - “anisohydric”: decrease water status; but risks hydraulic failure
- natural ecosystems: drought-resistant plants develop extensive roots to acquire water
- but, may not work on green roofs due to limited water 
- some notes on methods:
  - Used previous climatic dataset to help simulate realistic rainfall events 
  - acquired crop coefficients as part of water balance model 
- main findings:
  - high crop factor (>1) increased water retention, but suffered from drought  
  - plants with crop factors (0.6 < k < 1) with drought avoidance --> ideal for balancing stormwater retention and drought risk

[@Zhang2018] Zhang et al. 2018. STOTEN ref

- tested green roof monoculture and mixtures on stormwater retention based on water-use strategies
- based in Australia (warm dry ecosystem); need to optimize rainfall retention and plant survival 
- plants needs to have high transpiration after rainfall and survive dry period
- biodiversity may improve retention through transgressive overyielding and selection effect
- life-form diversity is likely complicated by differences in biomass and rainfall interceptions
  - grass monocultures have higher retention than some life-form mixtures
  - possibility: unmeasured traits may affect retention
- used plants with different water-use strategies (plastic, conservative)
- green roofs captured at least 73% of rainfall
- retention was not always higher in mixtures than monocultures
  - affected by watering regime --> water-use strategies
- certain sedum species have poor ability to retain water
  - root systems create large pore channels that increased water flow in substrate
  - created a selection effect (i.e., high cover) and reduced water retention performance

# Methodology: root sampling 

[@Perez-Harguindeguy2013] Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013. Austr J Botany

- root mass fraction
  - distribution of biomass to roots
  - best way is to look at turnover rates; but it's time-consuming
  - otherwise, root:shoot ratio works well since this metric is bounded at 0 to 1
  - fast-growers tend to have higher RMF
  - although, high RMF doesn’t always mean a high resource-uptake rate
  - if similar mass, RMF works well. If not, try to use allometries for range of different masses
- specific root length
  - “ratio of root length to dry mass of fine roots”; comparable to SLA
  - species high SRL still might have low tissue density; need to measure both!
  - roots grown in pots constrain age; rule of thumb is that roots should fit in palm
- processing root samples:
  - unwashed roots can be stored for about a week without a lot of damage
  - 50% ethanol solution might work well to preserve root for a while 
  - gently wash low-density roots; hose down high-dense roots
  - speed of washing roots depends on soil type; sandy soil is the best!
  - stop washing roots when you lose some fine roots, then pluck away
  - sort live roots from dead roots with a dissecting microscope
  - after that, digitize them using a low end-flatbanner (ideally 1600 dpi)
  - roots appear crisp and clean if submerged in a bit of water within a tray
  - after scanning, roots should be dried for 48hr @ 60 C
- root-system morphology
  - maximum rooting depth
  - lateral extent
  - intensity of exploration

[@Pierret2013] Pierret et al. 2013. Plant Soil
- talks about the potential use of a free open-source software "IJ_RHIZO",
  - compares both root length and average root diameter 
- to test if the Kimura IJ_RHIZO is unbiased compared to Tennant WinRHIZO
- WinRHIZO Tennant and Kimura IJ_RHIZO were highly correlated for root length
- estimates (r = 0.99), with a slight overestimation of the latter estimator
- average root diameter estimate had a weaker correlation between the two estimators,
- advantage of IJ_Rhizo is that it provides the root radius distribution
- WinRHIZO uses TIF images while IJ_Rhiz uses JPEG

[@Bouma2000] Bouma et al. 2000. Plant Soil. Recs for scanning root traits 
- specific root length = ability for plants to explore soil + resource uptake
- measuring root length can take some time; requires faster methods
- we can automate this measurement, but it’s still sensitive to proposed parameters
- thus, sensitivity analyses for SRL are needed (Delta-T Scan + WinRHIZO)
- used three grass species; took six root samples from each individual + stained red 
  - *Spartina anglica* 
  - *Puccinellia maritima*
  - *Elymus pycnanthus*
- root hair may interfere with root length measurement
- recommendations (and report this too!)
  - do a quick line-intersect method on new species (obs > 400)
  - stain for 24 hours using neutral red (although this might vary per species)
  - sample density (0.5 mm mm−2)
  - scanning resolution (400 dpi) 	
  - scanning threshold 
  
  
[@Birouste2014] Birouste et al. 2014. Plant Soil 
- tissue density - “amount of structural material invested by unit of volume”
- low-dense tissue means fast growth; rapid expansion with low carbon cost
- but.. low root lifespan and vulnerable to pathogens + herbivory 
- clearly an important plant strategy but there is no standard way to measure it
- different terminologies exist too (so confusing when read different papers!):
  - e.g., root tissue density, root dry matter content (RDMC), root mass density, root specific gravity
- three methods exists so far: Archimedes, image analysis, RDMC
- RDMC is the cheapest, quick method (I prefer this):
  - seems like an analogue to leaf dry matter content (LDMC)
  - calculation: root dry weight/root fresh weight
  - linked by root density (which is assumed to be approximately 1)
- root fresh weight is a proxy for root volume
- R2 (0.97%) for pot grown species compared to Archimedes method
- underestimation may be higher proportion of air spaces 
- need to account for water saturation when measuring fresh weight 
- image analysis were really sensitive to proposed parameters + thresholds


[@Delory2017] Delory et al. 2017. Methods Eco Evol - Comparing image analysis software
- compared IJ_RHIZO and WinRHIZO for root length density and specific root length
- RLD: “root length per unit volume of soil” 
  - architectural trait: exploring soil for limited resources
- SRL: “root length per unit root biomass” 
  - morphological trait - info on carbon construction costs for resource uptake 
- need to know total root length before calculating RLD + SRL
- compared three methods for SRL + RLD: Line-intersect, WinRHIZO + IJ_RHIZO
  - used 50 digital images to help with comparing methods; looked for accuracy 
-  didn’t stain the roots in case chemical analyses were needed later on
- apparently, a high RLD increase the chance of overlapping roots
- IJ_Kimura was found to be a good alternative to WinRHIZO 
  - open-source and free; can edit and tweak macro if needed
  - some info on parameters:
    - excluded border of 40, 50 or 60 pixels width
    - perform particle cleaning (size of the smallest particle: 1 mm²)
    - circularity of particles: 0·75)
    - automatic thresholding
    - resolution of 400 dpi
    
[@Himmelbauer2004] Himmelbauer et al. 2004. Plant and Soil 
- compared ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO softwares; based on different algorithms
- used roots of cereal crops: Triticum durum and Hordeum vulgare
- stained the roots to improve the scanning threshold; suggests staining for 5-10 minutes)
- lack of detail for how algorithm works on ROOTEDGE
- scanning roots in water is a good practice, but can produce shadows
- estimated root length had a high correlation with actual root length for both softwares
- stanning does in fact increase the contrast between roots and background 

[@Rose2017] Rose. 2017. Front Plant Sci 
- looked two common root traits: specific root length and root tissue density (RTD)
  - based on measurements of length (L) or volume (V) and root dry weight
- calculation can be simple, but assume that a homogeneous diameter for all roots
- length could be overestimated, volume is underestimated 
- does not affect specific root area; root surface area is proportional to diameter
- WinRHIZO: popular commercial software to analyze root traits
  - uses two-dimensional images 
  - computes length, diameter, surface area and volume of root samples
  - length and projected area are measured based on pixel counts
  - surface area, diameter and volume are estimated as if roots are round
- goal of this paper: raise awareness for overestimation of SRL and RTD when calculated from average diameter
- findings: SRL and RTD value were indeed overestimated
  - more error for herbaceous plants than woody species 
  - greater within sample diameter heterogeneity for the herbs
- assumption that roots are round is correct, but not constant root diameter
- solution: add up volumes of the different diameter classes

[@Kimura1999] Kimura. 1998. Plant Soil - Image analysis technique
- previous methods require random overlap, which is time-consuming 
- count number of pixels of the thinned images and multiply it by a factor
- freeman chain code; accurate but severely affected by orientation
- increase in sample size causes root overlaps
- underestimation of root lengths; overlap correction methods 
- newly proposed methods: Kimura’s algorithm ⇒ estimates root length
  - effect of sample orientation and size is minimized
  - underestimation caused by root overlap is reduced by counting overlaps directly
  - skeletonize digitized root images into multiple line objects 
  - “removes edge pixels from objects repeatedly” 
  - “...until only skeleton pixels are diameter of the sample”
- underestimated values; possible reasons could be:
  - length of the tip was not always reduced 
  - thinning induced an additional medial axis
- account for overlapping pixels (unlike line-intersect), multiple line objects
- compromise between small bias + insensitivity to preferential root orientation 

Tennant. 1975. J Ecol
- measuring length estimates while controlling for area and length of intersect line
- uses a grid; I believe this accounts for any overlapping roots; some studies use 2X2cm
- formula: root length = c X number of intercepts X Grid unit
- R2 of 0.99 between estimated and actual length (pretty good actually)

# Methodology: greenhouse experiments 

[@Poorter2012] Poorter et al. 2012. Func Plant Bio 
- plant biologists rely on experimental setups in which plants are cultivated in labs
- generalisations across experiments: results are replicable and reproducible
- a pragmatic guide to capture the minimum level of knowledge of how to grow plants under "ideal" conditions
- where to conduct the experiment?
  - experimental gardens (cheapest solution)
  - glasshouses (more expensive than gardens, but cheaper than chambers) 
    - better control of water supply 
    - protection against too low temperatures
    - experience higher-than-outdoor air temperatures during nights)
    - lower irradiance because of shading
    - can extend experiments (strong economic argument) 
    - significant spatial heterogeneities in irradiance
  - climate-controlled chamber
    - orthogonal dissection of environmental factors 
    - good replicability of experiments
    - disadvantages: too controlled, high vertical light profiles, large spatial variability
- which rooting mediums to choose? 
  - pots
    - pots filled with an inert solid medium
    - mimic the higher mechanical impedance to root growth
    - nutrient availability of commercially provided soil will vary 
    - root damage may occur if pots are black +  direct solar radiation
    - the smaller the pot the stronger roots become pot-bound
- how many replicates per treatment?
  - fix the location of plants and include this location as subplot (block) in the statistical analysis
  - blocks should be arranged 
  - known variation in climate conditions among blocks is maximised
  - variation among blocks is maximizesd; within block is minimized 
  - re-arranges pots within a block to avoid edge effects 
- plant size within a population of individually grown plants 
  - does not show a normal distribution, but rather a log-normal one
- if you want to test for both significance + magnitude
  - then you might want to increase sample size
  - simulations show that 12 reps accounts for ~30% of experiments

 [@Poorter2012a] Poorter et al. 2012. Func Plant Bio - Does pot size matter?
- experiments are often conducted on plants grown in some kind of container
- pot size seems to have received little consideration; not reported in methods
- use of small pots in experimental biology
  - suggests more experiments or increased replication
  - but, comes with biological constraints; reduced resources + root growth
- determine plant size-pot size relationship through a meta-analysis on 65 papers
- plants are likely to be over 3 times larger in 2L pots than in pots of 0.2L
- RMF decreased by a small but significant extent as pot size doubled
- small pots have greater surface areas + heat up more quickly
- root confinement per se may cause growth retardation
- pot size effects are saturating when biomass:rooting voume ratio values exceed the 2g X L–1
- pot size should chosen carefully during planning phase of an experiment
  - includes choosing right volume, right shape + height of pots 

# Methodology: statistics

[@Greenland2016] Greenland et al. 2016. Eur J Epidem
- huge misuse of statistics among researchers; lead to journals banning some practices
- solution: basic teaching of general methods needs to be improved
- stats models - math representation that captures variability; big list of assumptions
- things can get more complicated if assumptions aren’t met
- models are presented in abstract forms, sometimes ignore assumptions
- one assumption is looking at test hypothesis - zero effect (on average)
- frequentist - “hypothetical frequencies of data patterns under assumed statistical model”
- p-values - “observed statistical significance” for the test hypothesis
  - “compatibility between observed data + prediction of ENTIRE statistical model”
  - distance is measured using a test statistic (e.g., chi-squared test stat) 
  - p-value tests all assumptions about how data were generated 
  - note: a very small p-value does not tell us which assumption is incorrect
  - can be viewed us a continuous measure from [0-1] (1 == perfect compatibility)
- moving from tests to estimates: 
  - different effect sizes for a targeted effect (point estimates)
  - a range of sizes - 95% confidence interval (acts a summary here)
  - interpretation: repeat 95% of CI (validly), then 95% will contain true effect size
- important consideration of p-values
  - p-value assumes test hypothesis is true; it’s not a hypothesis probability 
  - a small p-value suggests unusual data (relative to test hypothesis + assumptions)
  - a large p-value suggests data are not unusual; could be large random error
  - p > 0.05; does not mean there are no observed differences; look a 95% CI
  - p > 0.05 and p >= 0.05 do not mean the same thing! 
  - only use inequalities when p-values are very very small (e.g. <0.001)
- statistical significance: property of statistical tests, not observed phenomenon
- use a one-sided tail test if above or below zero effect size; default is two-sided 
- several guidelines (overall)
  - look at p-values, effect size and confidence intervals together!
  - carefully consider all assumptions of your statistical and experimental models
  - statistical results could be compatible with an alternative hypothesis (see CI’s)
  - best way to statistically evaluate multiple studies: do a meta-analysis!
  - any opinions about certainty cannot be inferred only from statistical methods 
  - describe full sequence of events since statistic methods have assumptions
