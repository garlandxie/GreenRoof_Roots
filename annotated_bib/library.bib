abstract = {Plants make important contributions to the services provided by engineered ecosystems such as green roofs. Ecologists use plant species traits as generic predictors of geographical distribution, interactions with other species, and ecosystem functioning, but this approach has been little used to optimize engineered ecosystems. Four plant species traits (height, individual leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) were evaluated as predictors of ecosystem properties and services in a modular green roof system planted with 21 species. Six indicators of ecosystem services, incorporating thermal, hydrological, water quality, and carbon sequestration functions, were predicted by the four plant traits directly or indirectly via their effects on aggregate ecosystem properties, including canopy density and albedo. Species average height and specific leaf area were the most useful traits, predicting several services via effects on canopy density or growth rate. This study demonstrates that easily measured plant traits can be used to select species to optimize green roof performance across multiple key services.},

abstract = {Subtropical climatic conditions can contribute to the death of the$\backslash$naerial parts of constructed wetland plants in winter. This presents a$\backslash$nbarrier to the widespread application of constructed wetland and is an$\backslash$nissue that urgently needs to be solved. Three contrasting experiments,$\backslash$nthe plant-intercropping model (A), the warm-seasonal plant model (B),$\backslash$nand the non-plant model (C), were studied in terms of their efficiency$\backslash$nin removing pollutants, and the change in root structure of plants in$\backslash$nthe plant-intercropping model within the vertical-flow constructed$\backslash$nwetlands. The results indicate that model A was able to solve the$\backslash$naforementioned problem. Overall, average removal rates of three$\backslash$npollutants (CODCr, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP)) using$\backslash$nmodel A were significantly higher than those obtained using models B and$\backslash$nC (P {\textless} 0.01). Moreover, no significant differences in removal rates of$\backslash$nthe three pollutants were detected between A and B during the higher$\backslash$ntemperature part of the year (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conversely, removal rates of$\backslash$nthe three pollutants were found to be significantly higher using model A$\backslash$nthan those observed using model B during the lower temperature part of$\backslash$nthe year (P {\textless} 0.01). Furthermore, the morphologies and internal$\backslash$nstructures of plant roots further demonstrate that numerous white roots,$\backslash$nwhose distribution in soil was generally shallow, extend further under$\backslash$nmodel A. The roots of these aquatic plants have an aerenchyma structure$\backslash$ncomposed of parenchyma cells, therefore, roots of the cold-seasonal$\backslash$nplants with major growth advantages used in A were capable of creating a$\backslash$nmore favorable vertical-flow constructed wetlands mediamicroenvironment.$\backslash$nIn conclusion, the plant-intercropping model (A) is more suitable for$\backslash$nuse in the cold environment experienced by constructed wetland during$\backslash$nwinter.},

abstract = {Key microalgal species are currently being exploited as biomanufacturing platforms using mass cultivation systems. The opportunities to enhance productivity levels or produce non-native compounds are increasing as genetic manipulation and metabolic engineering tools are rapidly advancing. Regardless of the end product, there are both environmental and industrial risks associated to open pond cultivation of mutant microalgal strains. A mutant escape could be detrimental to local biodiversity and increase the risk of algal blooms. Similarly, if the cultivation pond is invaded by a wild-type (WT) microalgae or the mutant reverts to WT phenotypes, productivity could be impacted. To investigate these potential risks, a response surface methodology was applied to determine the competitive outcome of two Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains, a WT (CC-124) and a high-lipid accumulating mutant (CC-4333), grown in mixotrophic conditions, with differing levels of nitrogen and initial WT to mutant ratios. Results of the growth experi- ments show that mutant cells have double the exponential growth rate of the WT in monoculture. However, due to a slower transition from lag phase to exponential phase, mutant cells are outcompeted by the WT in every co-culture treatment. This suggests that, under the conditions tested, outdoor cultivation of the C. reinhardtii cell wall-deficient mutant strains does not carry a significant environmental risk to its WT in an escape scenario. Furthermore, lipid results show the mutant strain accumulates over 200{\%} more TAGs per cell, at 50 mg L−1 NH4Cl, compared to the WT, therefore, the fragility of the mutant strain could impact on overall industrial productivity.},

abstract = {Consideration of the scale at which communities are defined both taxonomi cally and spatially can reconcile apparently contradictory results on the extent to which plants show phylogenetic niche conservatism. In plant communities in north central Florida, we collected species abundances in 55 0.1-ha plots in several state parks. When communities were defined narrowly to include a single phylogenetic lineage, such as Quercus, Pinus, or Ilex, neighbors tended to be less related than expected (phylogenetic overdispersion) or there was no pattern. If the same communities were defined more broadly, such as when all seed plants were included, neighbors tended to be more related than expected (phylogenetic clustering). These results provide evidence that species interactions among close relatives influence community structure, but they also show that niche conservatism is increasingly evident as communities are defined to include greater phylogenetic diversity. We also found that, as the spatial scale is increased to encompass greater environmental heterogeneity, niche conservatism emerges as the dominant pattern. We then examined patterns of trait evolution in relation to trait similarity within communities for 11 functional traits for a single phylo genetic lineage (Quercus) and for all woody plants. Among the oaks, convergent evolution of traits important for environmental filtering contributes to the observed pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion. At the broader taxonomic scale, traits tend to be conserved, giving rise to phylogenetic clustering. The shift from overdispersion to clustering can be explained by the increasing},

abstract = {Plant functional traits affect the capacity of herbivores to find, choose, and consume plants. However, in a community composed of different plant species, it is unclear what proportion of herbivory on a focal plant is explained by its own traits and which is explained by the characteristics of the surrounding vegetation (i.e., nonadditive effects). Moreover, nonadditive effects could be positive or negative, and it is not known if they are related to community properties such as diversity. To quantify nonadditive effects, we developed four different additive models based on monoculture herbivory rates or plant traits and combined them with measurements of standing invertebrate herbivore damage along an experimental plant diversity gradient ranging from monocultures to 60-species mixtures. In all four models, positive nonadditive effects were detected, i.e., herbivory levels were higher in polycultures than what was expected from monoculture data, and these effects contributed up to 25{\%} of the observed variance in herbivory. Importantly, the nonadditive effects, which were defined as the deviance of the models' predictions from the observed herbivory, were positively correlated with the communities' plant species richness. Consequently, interspecific interactions appear to have an important impact on the levels of herbivory of a community. Identifying those community properties that capture the effects of these interactions is a next important challenge for our understanding of how the environment interacts with plant traits to drive levels of herbivory.},

abstract = {Current design of bioretention systems is intended to intercept and retain stormwater, enhance infiltration, and remove organic particulates, nutrients, pathogens, metals, and other contaminants using natural processes that derive from the interactions of water, soil, microbes, plants, and animals. Most bioretention systems function as isolated patches of various shapes and sizes surrounded by impervious surface. A significant body of ecological theory has been developed that addresses the relationships among species composition, diversity, and ecosystem function, and how these vary with spatial structure. Here we highlight how such theories may be applied to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of bioretention systems. We consider (1) the role of plant and animal species that function as ecosystem engineers, (2) biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships, (3) complexity and stability, (4) disturbance and succession, and (5) spatial theory. Future testing of the utility of these theories may occur through incorporation of experiments into the design of bioretention systems or through meta-analysis of systems that span a range of configurations and biotic features.

abstract = {Biotic resistance is the ability of species in a community to limit the invasion of other species. However, biotic resistance is not widely used to control invasive plants. Experimental, functional, and modeling approaches were combined to investigate the processes of invasion by Ageratina altissima (white snakeroot), a model invasive species in South Korea. We hypothesized that (1) functional group identity would be a good predictor of biotic resistance to A. altissima, whereas a species identity effect would be redundant within a functional group, and (2) mixtures of species would be more resistant to invasion than monocultures. We classified 37 species of native plants into three functional groups based on seven functional traits. The classification of functional groups was based primarily on differences in life longevity and woodiness. A competition experiment was conducted based on an additive competition design with A. altissima and monocultures or mixtures of resident plants. As an indicator of biotic resistance, we calculated a relative competition index (RCIavg) based on the average performance of A. altissima in a competition treatment compared with that of the control where only seeds of A. altissima were sown. To further explain the effect of diversity, we tested several diversity–interaction models. In monoculture treatments, RCIavg of resident plants was significantly different among functional groups but not within each functional group. Fast-growing annuals (FG1) had the highest RCIavg, suggesting priority effects (niche pre-emption). RCIavg of resident plants was significantly greater in a mixture than in a monoculture. According to the diversity–interaction models, species interaction patterns in mixtures were best described by interactions between functional groups, which implied niche partitioning. Functional group identity and diversity of resident plant communities were good indicators of biotic resistance to invasion by introduced A. altissima, with the underlying mechanisms likely niche pre-emption and niche partitioning. This method has most potential in assisted restoration contexts, where there is a desire to reintroduce natives or boost their population size due to some previous level of degradation.},

abstract = {The relationship between species richness and productivity is important from both a basic, theoretical perspective and also because it has important ramifications for applied ecology including ecosystem restoration and the design of carbon offset plantings. While a more species-rich community is often believed to be more productive than a species-poor community, findings from observational and experimental studies differ and our understanding of the relationship comes largely from grasslands. Consequently, we aimed to determine for the first time the nature of the species richness-productivity relationship in a southern-hemisphere dry sclerophyll ecosystem. We investigated the impact of species richness on productivity, plant density and mean plant biomass at three sowing densities in three species assemblages. Eucalyptus globulus, Acacia mearnsii and Allocasuarina verticillata were each grown as monocultures and included in every subsequent level of species richness, forming three distinct species assemblages. Communities were grown in a glasshouse pot experiment for four months, then harvested and above-ground biomass measured. We found no general species richness-productivity relationship in the communities studied. There were no overall increases in productivity as species richness increased and in fact in most cases the productivity of communities with 4 and 8 species was lower than monocultures of the dominants. Importantly, density influenced the way richness affected productivity and this effect was dependent upon assemblage, indicating that species identity is a key determinant of productivity. These results demonstrate important ecological principles in a previously untested system. A key outcome of this experiment is that density alters the relationship between species richness and initial productivity in assemblages of Australian dry sclerophyll species. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Sulfate in effluent is a challenging issue for wastewater reuse around the world. In this study, sulfur (S) removal and transformation in five batch constructed wetlands (CWs) treating secondary effluent were investigated. The results showed that the presence of the plant cattail (Typha latifolia) had little effect on sulfate removal, while the carbon-rich litter it generated greatly improved sulfate removal, but with limited sulfide accumulation in the pore-water. After sulfate removal, most of the S was deposited with the valence states S (-II) and S (0) on the iron-rich gravel surface, and acid volatile sulfide was the main S sink in the litter-added CWs. High-throughput pyrosequencing revealed that sulfate-reducing bacteria (i.e. Desulfobacter) and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (i.e. Thiobacillus) were dominant in the litter-added CWs, which led to a sustainable S cycle between sulfate and sulfide. Overall, this study suggests that recycling plant litter and iron-rich filling material in CWs gives an opportunity to utilize the S in the wastewater as both an electron acceptor for sulfate reduction and as an electron donor for nitrate reduction coupled with sulfide oxidation. This leads to the simultaneous removal of sulfate, nitrate, and organics without discharging toxic sulfide into the receiving water body.},

abstract = {With the global loss of natural wetlands, waterbirds have become increasingly dependent on alternative and artificial habitats, but the use of such wetlands by waterbirds is typically opportunistic and little consideration has been given to the potential implications for water treatment or waterbird conservation objectives. Wastewater treatment wetlands are currently of critical importance for certain waterbird species in some parts of the world, and we illustrate this with an example fromsouth-eastern Australia. Furthermore, we argue that their significance is likely to increase as they offer the most realistic means of treating wastewater in developing countries, where the demand for improved sanitation to lift people out of poverty is intense. There is little scientific evidence to guide the construction of wastewater treatment wetlands with waterbird conservation in mind. The use of wastewater by waterbirds poses health risks for both birds and humans and these risks must be better understood. Wastewater treatment wetlands are not a substitute for natural wetlands and reliance upon them should not compromise wetland conservation efforts. Nonetheless, they are a potentially valuable resource for waterbirds, and research should be directed towards deepening our understanding of their global distribution; food-web dynamics; methods of deterring or excluding birds when bird or human health may be compromised; the effects of wastewater contaminants and pathogens on birds; and the role of waterbirds in human disease transmission},

abstract = {The paper reports findings of a natural invasibility study in constructed Mediterranean grasslands, located in the Greek site of the BIODEPTH project. Three different components of invasibility, i.e. species richness, abundance and rarity of invaders, have been monitored in experimental plots where the resident diversity ranged from monocultures to 18-species mixtures. Invaders' richness and abundance were negatively correlated to the resident diversity, while the occurrence of rare invaders was strongly positively correlated to the resident diversity. Standing biomass explained also a significant part of the variation of communities' invasibility. Soil nutrients and structural traits of the constructed vegetation such as the space-filling showed no influence in the definition of the overall pattern of invasibility in these communities. A verbal model of selection of invaders at the neighbourhood scale is proposed to explain these diverging trends of invasibility.},

abstract = {The use of phylogenies in ecology is increasingly common and has broadened our understanding of biological diversity. Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify 'anchor' representatives: for $\alpha$-diversity metrics these are PD (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis has changed the way researchers conduct literature reviews not only in medical and social sciences but also in biological sciences. Meta-analysis in biological sciences, especially in ecology and evolution (which we refer to as ‘biological' meta-analysis) faces somewhat different methodological problems from its counterparts in medical and social sciences, where meta-analytic techniques were originally developed. The main reason for such differences is that biological meta-analysis often integrates complex data composed of multiple strata with, for example, different measurements and a variety of species. Here, we review methodological issues and advancements in biological meta-analysis, focusing on three topics: (1) non-independence arising from multiple effect sizes obtained in single studies and from phylogenetic relatedness, (2) detecting and accounting for heterogeneity, and (3) identifying publication bias and measuring its impact. We show how the marriage between mixed-effects (hierarchical/multilevel) models and phylogenetic comparative methods has resolved most of the issues under discussion. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of across-study and within-study meta- analysis, and propose how the use of within-study meta-analysis can improve many empirical studies typical of ecology and evolution.

abstract = {Species diversity is important for a range of ecosystem processes and properties, including the resistance to single and multiple stressors. It has been suggested that genetic diversity may play a similar role, but empirical evidence is still relatively scarce. Here, we report the results of a microcosm experiment where four strains of the marine diatom Skeletonema marinoi were grown in monoculture and in mixture under a factorial combination of temperature and salinity stress. The strains differed in their susceptibility to the two stressors and no strain was able to survive both stressors simultaneously. Strong competition between the genotypes resulted in the dominance of one strain under both control and salinity stress conditions. The overall productivity of the mixture, however, was not related to the dominance of this strain, but was instead dependent on the treatment; under control conditions we observed a positive effect of genetic richness, whereas a negative effect was observed in the stress treatments. This suggests that interactions among the strains can be both positive and negative, depending on the abiotic environment. Our results provide additional evidence that the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship is also relevant at the level of genetic diversity.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies have shown that genetic diversity within plant species can influence important ecological processes. Here, we report a two-year wetland mesocosm experiment in which genotypic richness of Phragmites australis was manipulated to examine its effects on primary productivity and nitrogen removal from water. We used six genotypes of P. australis, and compared primary productivity and nitrogen concentration in the outflow water of the mesocosms between monocultures and polycultures of all six genotypes. We also quantified the abundance of denitrifying bacteria, as denitrification is a primary mechanism of nitrogen removal in addition to the biotic uptake by P. australis. Plant productivity was significantly greater in genotypic polycultures compared to what was expected based on monocultures. This richness effect on productivity was driven by both complementary and competitive interactions among genotypes. In addition, nitrogen removal rates of mesocosms were generally greater in genotypic polycultures compared to those expected based on monocultures. This effect, particularly pronounced in autumn, may largely be attributable to the enhanced uptake of nitrogen by P. australis, as the abundance of nitrite reducers did not increase with plant genotypic diversity. Although our effect sizes were relatively small compared to previous experiments, our study emphasizes the effect of genotypic interactions in regulating multiple ecological processes.},

In addition, the strength and direction of plant–soil feedbacks depend on temporal shifts in abiotic environmental conditions. 2. We synthesize current knowledge on temporal aspects of plant–soil feedbacks and present new ideas to better understand and predict the effects of plant–soil feedbacks on community and ecosystem properties across temporal scales. 3. Explaining short-term temporal feedback dynamics requires us to better understand mechanistic linkages between plants, soil organisms and locally available resources. On the other hand, we need to refine our understanding of the context-dependency of plant–soil feedbacks, as the strength and direction of feedback interactions are influenced by ‘external' temporal ecosystem dynamics, such as variation in soil resource availability after disturbance or during succession. 4. Synthesis. Based on our synthesis of temporal aspects of plant–soil feedbacks, we suggest three main avenues for future research: (i) how plant–soil feedbacks changes with ontogeny, (ii) how plant and soil organism traits drive temporal variation in plant–soil feedbacks and (iii) how environmental changes across temporal scales alter the strength and direction of plant–soil feedbacks},

abstract = {A positive relationship between plant species richness and ecosystem functioning has been found in a number of experimental studies. Positive species interactions at high species numbers have been suggested as a cause, but mechanisms driving positive interactions have not often been tested. In this experiment we asked three questions: (1) What is the relationship between species richness and productivity in experimentally constructed moss communities? (2) Is this relationship affected by plant density? and (3) Can changes in moisture absorption and retention explain observed relationships? To answer these questions we exposed arctic tundra moss communities of different species richness levels (1-11 species) and two different densities in the greenhouse to two levels of drought (short and long). Biomass (by the community and individual species), height and community moisture absorption and retention were measured as response variables. High species diversity increased productivity (more so in low-density plots than in high-density plots), but only when plots were watered regularly. Plot moisture retention was improved at high species richness as well, and plant height and variation in height was increased compared to plants in monoculture. Under high-density and short-drought conditions 10 out of 12 species grew better in mixture than in monoculture, but under the long drought treatment only six species did. A positive feedback loop between biomass and improved humidity under high diversity was supported by path analysis. We conclude that in this community the relationship between species richness and productivity depends on moisture availability and density, with improved water absorption and retention likely to be the mechanism for increased plant growth when drought periods are short. Furthermore, since this is the opposite of what has been found for temperate moss communities, conclusions from one system cannot automatically be extrapolated to other systems.},

abstract = {1. Increasing cropping system diversity is one strategy for reducing reliance on external chemical inputs in agriculture and may have important implications for agro-ecosystem functions related to the regulation of weed populations and community assembly. However, the impacts of cropping system diversity on weed communities have not been evaluated formally in a study comparable with those performed in experimental grasslands, where much of the evidence regarding diversity-ecosystem function has been reported. We performed a field experiment in Michigan, USA, in which we manipulated the number of crop species grown in rotation and as winter cover crops over a 3-year period and in the absence of fertilizer and pesticides, to determine the impact of crop diversity on the abundance, composition and structure of the weed community. 2. Crop diversity treatments consisted of three row-crops, corn Zea mays L., soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr. and winter wheat Triticum aestivum L., grown in continuous monoculture and in 2- and 3-year annual rotations with and without cover crops (zero, one or two legume/small grain species). Weed communities were measured each year at peak biomass, with soil resources and light availability being measured over the course of the growing season in the final year of the study. 3. The effects on weed communities of the crop diversity treatments were dependent on rotation phase. In winter wheat, weed abundance and diversity (species richness, H' and D) were lowest in the two highest crop diversity treatments. Across all phases of the rotation, weed community structure was affected more by crop identity than crop diversity per se. 4. In general, the effects of crop diversity on weed communities were mainly the result of the presence of cover crops, which had strong effects on soil resource and light levels, particularly in winter wheat. 5. Synthesis and applications. Increasing crop diversity in the absence of external chemical inputs can result in changes in soil resource availability without a concomitant increase in the abundance of weeds or a shift to weed communities that are more difficult to manage.},

abstract = {In plant communities, invasion resistance may increase with diversity because empty niche space decreases simultaneously. However, it is not clear if this only applies to exotic species or also to native species arriving at a site with few other native species during community assembly. We tested the latter by transplanting four native species into experimental grassland communities varying in species richness form 1-16 (-60) species. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that invasion is less successful if the invading species belongs to a functional group that is already present in the community. The test invaders included a grass species (Festuca pratensis, FP), a short (Plantago lanceolata, PL) and a tall herb species (Knautia arvensis, KA), and a legume species (Trifolium pratense, TP). The same four functional groups also occurred alone or in all possible combinations in the different experimental communities. The overall performance of the transplants was negatively related to the logarithm of the species richness of host communities. Plant biomass declined by 58{\%}, 90{\%}, 84{\%} and 62{\%} in FP, PL, KA and TP, respectively, from monocultures to 16-species mixtures, indicating lower invasiveness of the two herbs than of the grass and the legume. Resident grasses showed a strong negative effect on the performance of all test invaders, whereas resident small and tall herbs had neutral, and resident legumes had positive effects. The case of the legumes indicates that contributions to invasion resistance need not parallel invasiveness. Communities containing resident species of only one functional group were most inhibitive to transplants of the same functional group. These results indicate that invasion resistance of experimental plant communities is related to the degree of niche overlap between resident species and invaders. This niche overlap can be high due to generally low amounts of empty niche space in species-rich resident communities or due to the occurrence of the same functional group as the one of the invader in the resident community. Stronger within-than between-functional-group invasion resistance may be the key mechanism underlying diversity effects on invasion resistance in grassland and other ecosystems at large.},

abstract = {1. Genetic diversity, like species diversity, can enhance resistance or resilience to perturbation. However, we know little about how disturbance intensity affects this relationship or what mechanisms underlie the positive effects of genetic diversity. 2. We experimentally tested the independent and interactive effects of seagrass genotypic diversity (two levels) and disturbance (three levels) on seagrass biomass in a 2-year field experiment. 3. Our results indicate that genotypic diversity enhances seagrass resilience from experimental biomass removal, but only at the highest level of disturbance; in the absence of disturbance, monocultures out-perform polycultures over the short term. 4. Following recovery from the planned experimental disturbance, a natural macroalgal bloom caused a loss of seagrass shoots in our plots. In this case polycultures lost fewer shoots than monocultures (i.e. were more resistant to the disturbance), and this positive effect of genetic diversity persisted until the end of the experiment (1 year in total, including 6 months after all plots had recovered to pre-disturbance densities). At the end of the 2-year experiment, polycultures had higher shoot density and above-ground biomass than monocultures. 5. The positive effects of diversity on shoot density and biomass were caused by both trait-independent complementarity (TIC; due to differential resource use among clones) and positive dominance (due to one genotype achieving high density in both monoculture and polyculture). 6.Synthesis. Our results confirm that genetic diversity, like species diversity, can influence disturbance response and does so via similar mechanisms. They also highlight that over longer time frames, these effects are likely to result from a complex mix of dominance and complementarity mechanisms that depend on the traits of the specific taxa involved and the response variables of interest.},

abstract = {There is currently much debate about the relative importance of two contrasting mechanisms thought to be involved in regulating plant communities. One of these mechanisms is thought to result from species which possess particular traits, becoming dominant within the community and thus determining the abundance of other species. The second mechanism is thought to result from the complementarity of different species exploiting different resources and thus promoting co-existence. To investigate the relevant importance of these two mechanisms, a series of pot experiments were performed in which the competitive relationships of eight species of grass were estimated in monoculture, in pair-wise comparisons and by the impact of their removal on the remaining community. Although superficially above-ground biomass appeared to be a good predictor of competitive ability, more detailed analysis revealed that size was ineffective as a predictor of a species' impact on a community. In contrast there was evidence that complementarity was important in determining species-species interactions both at the level of pairs of species and even more so at community level. It is argued that complementarity is more important in diverse communities than in pair-wise interactions because complementarity is an emergent property of species diversity.},

abstract = {The natural world is increasingly defined by change. Within the next 100 years, rising atmospheric CO₂ concentrations will continue to increase the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events. Simultaneously, human activities are reducing global biodiversity, with current extinction rates at {\~{}}1,000 × what they were before human domination of Earth's ecosystems. The co-occurrence of these trends may be of particular concern, as greater biological diversity could help ecosystems resist change during large perturbations. We use data from a 200-year flood event to show that when a disturbance is associated with an increase in resource availability, the opposite may occur. Flooding was associated with increases in productivity and decreases in stability, particularly in the highest diversity communities. Our results undermine the utility of the biodiversity-stability hypothesis during a large number of disturbances where resource availability increases. We propose a conceptual framework that can be widely applied during natural disturbances.},

abstract = {* A plant that causes specific changes to soil biota may either positively or negatively affect the performance of the plant that subsequently grows in that location. These effects, known as plant–soil feedback, can affect plant species diversity at multiple spatial scales. * It has been hypothesized that positive plant–soil feedback reduces alpha (local) diversity by allowing dominance by early-arriving species, but increases gamma (regional) diversity by promoting community divergence (increased beta diversity) through the emergence of alternative stable states. In contrast, negative plant–soil feedback has been thought to increase alpha diversity by allowing local species coexistence, but to reduce gamma diversity by promoting community convergence (reduced beta diversity). Although widely accepted, these hypotheses do not consider the possibility that plant species differ in their effect on, and their response to, a given other species via soil biota. In reality, plant–soil interactions can be complex, with the strength of the interactions variable between plant species. Using a basic simulation model of plant community assembly, we investigated how complex plant–soil interactions might affect plant diversity during succession. * When we included only positive or negative intraspecific plant–soil feedback in the model, with no variation in the strength of interspecific plant–soil interactions, results were consistent with the conventional hypotheses. When we allowed the strength of plant–soil interactions to differ between species, plant–soil interactions enhanced alpha diversity initially and beta and gamma diversity subsequently. Diversity enhancement occurred not necessarily because alternative stable states emerged, but primarily because complex plant–soil interactions lengthened the time during which local species composition changed. Due to the longer time for changes in species composition, the high level of beta and gamma diversity at the early stage of succession was maintained for a long time despite eventual community convergence. Thus, diversity enhancement was often transient, though long-lasting, making the conventional concept of alternative stable states inadequate for explaining diversity. * Synthesis. Based on these findings, we propose the new hypothesis that complex plant–soil interactions enhance plant species diversity by delaying community convergence. This hypothesis highlights the role of plant–soil interactions as a driver of long-lasting transient dynamics of community assembly.},

abstract = {The urban environment has distinctive biophysical features in relation to surrounding rural areas. These include an altered energy exchange creating an urban heat island, and changes to hydrology such as increased surface runoff of rainwater. Such changes are, in part, a result of the altered surface cover of the urban area. For example less vegetated surfaces lead to a decrease in evaporative cooling, whilst an increase in surface sealing results in increased surface runoff. Climate change will amplify these distinctive features. This paper explores the important role that the green infrastructure, i.e. the greenspace network, of a city can play in adapting for climate change. It uses the conurbation of Greater Manchester as a case study site. The paper presents output from energy exchange and hydrological models showing surface temperature and surface runoff in relation to the green infrastructure under current and future climate scenarios. The implications for an adaptation strategy to climate change in the urban environment are discussed},

abstract = {The goal of the present study is to assess how landscape configuration influenced the distribution of life-history traits across bird, carabid beetle and butterfly communities of mosaic forest landscapes in south-western France. A set of 12 traits was selected for each species, characterizing rarity, biogeographical distribution, body size, trophic guild, dispersal power, reproductive potential and phenology. We used a three-table ordination method, RLQ analysis, to link directly bird, beetle and butterfly traits to the same set of landscape metrics calculated in 400 m-radius buffers around sample points. RLQ analyses showed significant associations between life-history traits and landscape configuration for all three taxonomical groups. Threatened species from all groups were characterized by a combination of life traits that makes them especially sensitive to the fragmentation of herbaceous and shrub-dominated habitats at the landscape scale. These key life traits were low productivity, intermediate body mass, restricted geographic range, late phenology and ground gleaning for threatened birds, intermediate body size, spring adult activity, northern distribution and summer breeding period for threatened carabids, and restricted range, overwintering as eggs or larvae, low mobility, monophagy and short flight periods for threatened butterflies. Focusing on species life traits can provide a functional perspective, which helps to determine adequate measures for the conservation of threatened species and communities of several taxonomical groups in mosaic landscapes.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in understanding the linkages between above- and belowground communities, and very little is known about these linkages in tropical systems. Using an experimental site at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we examined whether plant diversity, plant community composition, and season influenced microbial communities. We also determined whether soil characteristics were related to differences in microbial communities. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition revealed that microbial community composition differed across a plant diversity gradient (plots contained 1, 3, 5, or over 25 species). Plant species identity also was a factor influencing microbial community composition; PLFA composition significantly varied among monocultures, and among three-species combinations that differed in plant species composition. Differences among treatments within each of these comparisons were apparent in all four sampling dates of the study. There was no consistent shift in microbial community composition between wet and dry seasons, although we did see significant changes over time. Of all measured soil characteristics, soil C/N was most often associated with changes in microbial community composition across treatment groups. Our findings provide evidence for human alteration of soil microbial communities via the alteration of plant community composition and diversity and that such changes are mediated in part by changes in soil carbon quality.},

abstract = {G. emini, a mechanistic model linking plant functional traits, plant populations, community dynamics, and ecosystem scale fluxes in grasslands has been reported in a companion paper (Soussana et al., 2012). For monocultures and six species mixtures of perennial grass species, this model has been successfully evaluated against experimental data of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and plant community structure across nitrogen and disturbance (cutting frequency) gradients. The G. emini model combines two categories of processes: (i) C and N fluxes, (ii) morphogenesis and architecture of roots and shoots and demography of clonal plant axes. These two process categories constrain the form and function of the simulated clonal plants within plastic limits. We show here that the plasticity of the simulated plant populations accounts for well-established empirical laws: (i) root:shoot ratio, (ii) self-thinning, (iii) critical shoot N content, and (iv) role of plant traits (specific leaf area and plant height) for population response to environmental gradients (nitrogen and disturbance). Moreover, we show that model versions for which plasticity simulation has been partly or fully suppressed have a reduced ANPP in monocultures and in binary mixtures and do not capture anymore productivity and dominance changes across environmental gradients. We conclude that, along environmental and competition gradients, the plasticity of plant form and function is required to maintain the coordination of multiple resource capture and, hence, to sustain productivity and dominance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many studies have investigated the influence of plant litter species composition on decomposition, but results have been context-dependent. Litter and soil are considered to constitute a decomposition continuum, but whether litter and soil ecosystems respond to litter identity and mixing in the same manner is unsure. In a field experiment utilizing 5 litter species and their mixture, we investigated whether the effects of litter identity and mixing on mass loss, nutrient dynamics, and decomposer communities are consistent across the litter-soil interface. In monoculture, mass loss and nitrogen (N) dynamics in the litter layer corresponded to the underlying soil N availability, demonstrating the continuum of resources from litter to soil. Litter microbial biomass and mesofauna abundance tended to be greater on litter with a faster decay rate and greater N release. However, soil decomposer abundance and diversity were not greater with higher soil N, causing litter and soil communities to respond differently to litter identity. Non-additive mass loss and N dynamics were observed after 6 months, and were correlated with non-additive litter microbial community composition and litter mesofauna communities, but all other aspects of the litter community and all measures of the soil community were additive. Decomposer communities and N dynamics did not respond similarly to the litter mixture across the litter-soil interface. This study is one of the few to comprehensively examine how a litter mixture influences decomposition dynamics and communities across the soil-litter interface, including multiple taxa and trophic levels. Our results demonstrate that processes associated with decomposition are decoupled for litter and soil, particularly in that litter showed non-additivity in mass loss, N release and decomposer community, but soil responses were largely additive. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We derive and test some assumptions and predictions of the Sampling Effect Hypothesis (SEH) by examining the relationship between the traits of species in monoculture and their relative abundance in mixture, and by comparing polyculture performance with single-species plots. Although we found a positive relationship between production in monoculture and dominance in mixtures as predicted by the SEH, the relationship had low explanatory power. Counter to predictions, the species with the highest monoculture biomass were not able to strongly dominate all mixtures; instead the dominance of these species decreased with increasing species richness. On average, polycultures did not achieve greater biomass than (transgressively overyield) the species in each mixture, or at each site, that was most productive in monoculture. However, mixture yields did transgressively overyield both the monoculture biomass of the dominant species in the mixtures, and the weighted average of all monocultures (non-transgressive overyielding), both of which were positively related to increasing species richness. The varying responses of different overyielding tests resulted because resource partitioning and positive interactions were often counter-balanced by selection for species with lower biomass than the highest-yielding monocultures. Judging whether or not mixtures overyield therefore depends in part upon which species is the basis for comparison. We present a new general framework for overyielding analysis where every monoculture provides a potential comparison and from which the most relevant tests can be selected.},

abstract = {While the positive role of macrophytes on removal efficiency in constructed wetlands has been well established, possible differences in performance between plants species of comparable life forms and sizes are much harder to demonstrate. We reviewed 35 experimental studies published in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings on the effect of macrophyte species selection on pollutant removal in SSFCW. The studies cover a wide range of macrophyte species, experimental approaches (from well-replicated microcosm experiments to comparison between full full-size constructed wetlands), climatic conditions (from tropical to cold-temperate) and types of effluent (domestic, industrial, etc.). Frequent methodological limitations in these studies compel caution in the interpretation of their results. Yet, the fact that the majority found some (occasionally large) differences in efficiency between plant species for one or more type of pollutant suggests that macrophyte species selection does matter. However, there is little generalization to be made that could help guide species selection for SSFCW, except for the exact conditions in which the experiments were done. For example, the same pair of species that was tested in different studies occasionally gave opposite results in terms of which one performs best. Also, most studies provided few insights on the mechanisms or plant properties that could explain the observed differences in plant species efficiency. Finally, we discuss other relevant research questions and approaches that could help better guide macrophyte species selection for CW. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Litter, as afterlife of plants, plays an important role in driving belowground decomposition processes. Here we tested effects of litter species identity and diversity on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics during litter decomposition in N-limited alpine meadow soil from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We incubated litters of four meadow species, a sedge ("S", Kobresia humilis), a grass ("G", Elymus nutans), a herb ("H", Saussurea superba), and a legume ("L", Oxytropis falcata), in monoculture and in mixture with meadow soil. CO2 release was measured 21 times during the incubation, and soil available N and microbial biomass C and N were measured before and after the experiment. The organic C decay rate did not differ much among soils amended with monocultures or mixtures of litter, except in the H, S, L, and S+H treatments, which had much higher decay rates. Potential decomposable C pools were lowest in the control, highest in the L treatment, and intermediate in the S treatment. Mineralized N was completely immobilized by soil microbes in all treatments except the control, S+L, and S+G+L treatments. Litter mixtures had both additive and non-additive effects on CO2-C emission (mainly antagonistic effects), net N mineralization (mainly synergistic), and microbial biomass C and N (both). Overall, these parameters were not significantly correlated with litter species richness. Similarly, microbial C or N was not significantly correlated with litter N content or C/N. However, cumulative CO2-C emission and net N mineralization were positively correlated with litter N content and negatively correlated with litter C/N. Litter N content and C/N rather than litter species richness drove the release of CO2-C and net available N in this ecosystem. The antagonistic effects of litter mixtures contributed to a modest release of CO2-C, but their synergistic effects enhanced net available N. We suggest that in alpine meadow communities, balancing species with high and low N contents will benefit soil carbon sequestration and plant competition for available N with soil microbes.},

We examined the branching patterns of plant root systems to test the expectation that these differ both in a species-specific fashion in species from habitats differing in soil resource availability and as a plastic response to varying resource levels. 2. We grew 17 species of winter annual plants in a common greenhouse environment at two soil resource levels. Water and all nutrients were varied in tandem. The species were from collections made at two stabilized sand dune sites in Israel; one a resource-poor desert site, the other a relatively rich mediterranean site. 3. Branching pattern was quantified by Fitter's altitude topological index. High values of this index indicate a herringbone branching pattern, with root systems consisting of a main axis and primary laterals only. Low values indicate a more dichotomous branching pattern. 4. Dicots showed the predicted plastic response, tending towards more herringbone root systems with decreased resource availability. Dicots from the lower-resource desert site had more herringbone root systems than those from the richer mediterranean site, although this difference was significant only when the species were grown under low-resource conditions. 5. Grasses were relatively invariant, with close to maximally herringbone topology and did not show any significant plastic response or differences between species of different habitats.},
annote = {Background
- Roots of only main axis and primary laterals efficient at resource uptake; but larger diameter means high C cost
- Dichotomous root systems have higher intraplant competition, but smaller mean root diameter and lower construction costs
- Low-resource environment: herringbone architecture; high-resource environment: dichotomous patterns
- Plastic response or species differences; tested these predictions using 17 species from two sites that differ greatly in soil-resource availability
- Plants from high-resource habitats should show the highest degree of morphological plasticity in general 

Methods
- Used winter annuals; harvested from high-resource and low-resource sites
- Greenhouse experiment 

Findings:
- Mostly consistent with Fitter {\&} Strickland 1991 predictions
- Dicots showed a plastic shift toward more herringbone branching patterns at low-resource levels
- Species from poorer environments did show a higher topological index as predicted, but only at lower-resource levels 
- Grass root morphology did not differ across resource levels; possible redundancy in their root system. Low investment costs.},

abstract = {Restoring ecosystem services in agriculture is vital to reach a sustainable food production. More specifically, developing farming practices which enhance biological pest control is a main issue for today's agriculture. The aim of this study was to assess whether the two strategies of complicating the search of host plants by pests by increasing plant diversity, and of supporting their natural enemies by managing habitats, could be combined simultaneously at the field scale to restore biological pest control and reduce chemical insecticide use. In Gembloux (Belgium), wildflower strips (WFS) were sown within wheat crops in which pests (i.e., aphids), their predators (i.e. aphidophagous hoverflies, lacewings and ladybeetles) and parasitoid wasps were monitored for 10 weeks in the period of May through July 2015 as indicators of the ES of pest control. Aphids were significantly reduced and adult hoverflies favoured in wheat in between WFS, compared to monoculture wheat plots. No significant differences were observed for adult lacewings, ladybeetles and parasitoids. In all treatments, very few lacewing and ladybeetle larvae were observed on wheat tillers. The abundance of hoverfly larvae was positively correlated with the aphid density on tillers in between WFS, showing that increasing food provisions by multiplying habitats within fields, and not only along margins, can help supporting aphidophagous hoverflies in crops. By enhancing the ecosystem services of biological pest control, this study shows that increasing both plant diversity and managing habitats for natural enemies may reduce aphid populations, hence insecticide use. Future research should continue this vein of work by quantifying the link between agricultural practices and the delivery of ecosystem services in order to guide future measures of agricultural policies.},

abstract = {1. Over the past decade, ecologists have tried to determine how changes in species composition and diversity affect ecosystem structure and function. Until recently, the majority of these studies have been conducted in terrestrial ecosystems and have not taken into account environmental variability. The purpose of this research was to determine how species identity and diversity in the freshwater zooplankton affected biomass of algae and zooplankton at two levels of nutrient enrichment. 2. Several species of cladocerans were grown alone and together in microcosms at both ambient and raised phosphorus concentrations to determine if the effects of consumer identity and diversity were nutrient dependent. 3. Total zooplankton biomass was greater, while algal biomass was lower, in mixed culture than in monoculture. The effects of zooplankton diversity on algal biomass, however, were only observed at raised phosphorus concentrations, suggesting that diversity effects were nutrient dependent. Specifically, diversity effects appeared to be related with biological mechanisms such as complementarity in resource use and/or facilitation. 4. More diverse communities of zooplankton appear to be better able to control algae than single species of zooplankton at high nutrient concentrations; therefore, zooplankton diversity may provide a buffer against eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems.},

abstract = {Wetlands provide critical habitat for a diverse group of organisms and provide important ecosystem services. Despite this, most natural wetlands have been lost to anthropogenic activities, and as a result, wetland construction is common mitigation practice. Therefore, examination of constructed wetland viability in replacing the function of lost wetlands is vital. Our primary objectives were to compare amphibian communities of shallow and deep constructed wetlands to natural wetlands and to identify which wetland characteristics affect species composition. All wetlands were hydrologically isolated and fishless; natural wetlands had an ephemeral hydrology, and constructed wetland hydrology varied from ephemeral to permanent. Overall, constructed wetlands did not sufficiently replicate natural wetlands with respect to the amphibian community. However, two of our constructed wetlands had a drying period and exhibited communities more similar to natural wetlands. Hydroperiod and canopy closure were indicators of amphibian community composition. Many species observed in natural wetlands were rare in shallow constructed and absent in deep constructed wetlands. Additionally, dominant predator species (primarily Lithobates catesbeianus, Lithobates clamitans, and Notophthalmus viridescens) associated with permanent water were more abundant in constructed wetlands. Water depth, pH, and emergent vegetation were lower in natural wetlands. These data influenced land managers to revise construction methods and to renovate deep constructed wetlands by creating gradual slopes, decreasing maximum depth to 20 cm or less, maintaining canopy cover, and decreasing soil compaction to attempt replication of natural wetland hydrology.},

abstract = {To conduct a meta-analysis, one needs to express the results from a set of related studies in terms of an outcome measure, such as a standardized mean difference, correlation coefficient, or odds ratio. The observed outcome from a single study will differ from the true value of the outcome measure because of sampling variability. The observed outcomes from a set of related studies measuring the same outcome will, therefore, not coincide. However, one often finds that the observed outcomes differ more from each other than would be expected based on sampling variability alone. A likely explanation for this phenomenon is that the true values of the outcome measure are heterogeneous. One way to account for the heterogeneity is to assume that the heterogeneity is entirely random. Another approach is to examine whether the heterogeneity in the outcomes can be accounted for, at least in part, by a set of study-level variables describing the methods, procedures, and samples used in the different studies. The purpose of the present paper is to discuss these different approaches with particular emphasis on the interpretation of the results and practical issues.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that soil water lost through transpiration by weeds can intensify crop drought stress, and that this is an important mechanism by which weed competition decreases yields and crop water productivity (CWP). To assess the impact of weed competition on soil water uptake and crop drought stress, a 3-year field experiment was conducted with maize (Zea mays L.) grown in monoculture and in combination with high-density stands of three troublesome weed species (Setaria faberi Herrm., Abutilon theophrasti Medic., and Amaranthus retroflexus L.). Independent of weed species type, when canopy light interception was largely unchanged by the presence of weeds, maize-weed mixtures did not deplete more soil water than maize grown in monoculture. Conversely, when early weed growth was vigorous, maize-weed mixtures intercepted more light early in the growing season and this resulted in higher initial rates of water depletion and drier soils. In both cases, measurements of stomatal conductance suggested that the internal water status of the maize was not significantly impacted by the presence of weeds as the soil dried. CWP was influenced by weed competition and in the most extreme case declined by almost 50{\%} relative to monoculture maize (2.6kgm-3vs. 5.0kgm-3). However, the impact of weeds on CWP was not uniform. Under low yield loss scenarios (ca. 10{\%}), weeds had little impact on the soil water balance and CWP did not markedly decline relative to monoculture maize. Our results suggest that if weeds do not increase canopy light interception and are subordinate to lower parts of the canopy, high-density infestations can be retained in the field without increasing the probability of drought or substantially reducing CWP. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Although well known from terrestrial systems, documentations of this relationship from marine organisms, and particularly planktonic microorgan-isms, are still limited. Here we experimentally tested the effects of genotypic diversity on ecologically relevant cellular parameters (growth, primary production, particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, particulate organic phosphorus and biogenic silica) at optimal and suboptimal salinity conditions in a marine phytoplankton species. Multiple clonal genotyped and phenotypically characterized isolates of the diatom Skeletonema marinoi from the Baltic Sea were grown in monocultures and mixes of 5 and 20 clones at native (5 psu) and reduced (3 psu) salinities and respective parameters were compared. Re-genotyping of 30 individuals from each population at five microsatellite loci at the end of the experiment confirmed maintenance of genotypic richness. Although a diversity effect on growth was not detected, primary production and particulate organic nutrients were positively affected by increased diversity independent of salinity condition. Under salinity stress, highest values of primary production and particulate organic nitrogen content were measured at the high diversity level. The observed diversity effects emphasize the importance of genetic diversity of phytoplankton populations for ecological functions.},

abstract = {Invasive, non-native plant species often outcompete native species and reduce biodiversity. Invasive plants frequently begin growth before native plants, yet few studies have examined whether invasives win in competition partly by colonizing disturbed sites more quickly or by beginning growth earlier in the season than native plants (i.e. due to priority effects). We hypothesized that invasive plant species would benefit more from priority effects than would comparable native species and that earlier growth of invasive species would decrease plant biodiversity. To test this hypothesis, we grew three pairs of invasive and native plant species from three different functional groups/plant families (C-3 grasses/Poaceae, non-leguminous forbs/Asteraceae, and legumes/Fabaceae). We seeded each of the species 3 weeks before seeding the other five species into large pots in a greenhouse. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found much stronger priority effects with invasive than native species. Each invasive species formed a near-monocultures when seeded first (97.5 {\%} of total biomass, on average) whereas native species did not similarly dominate (29.8 {\%} of total biomass, on average). Similarly, Simpson's species diversity was 81 {\%} higher when the initially sown species was native rather than invasive. The literature suggests that invasive species in the field often begin growth earlier in the spring than native species and that climate change may increasingly allow invasives to begin growth before native species, indicating invasive priority effects may become increasingly common.},

abstract = {Root length has a touch of mystery to it, reflecting the difficulty in extracting fine roots from the soil, and the enormous length these roots can attain. For example, Dittmer (1937) excavated the entire root system of a single rye plant, which consisted of 13,815,672 branches and had a total length of 622 km with a surface area of 237 m 2 , and a total root hair length of 11,000 km. Since then, progress has been made in the methodology of assessing root length and in understanding the variation in it, but there still remains an air of mystery around root length as even the newest findings are often contradictory. Investigations have often focused on Specific Root Length (SRL), a trait which characterizes the economical aspects of a root system, stating the costs––mass––per potential return––root length. SRL has been shown to increase, decrease, or stay constant in response to nutrient limitation (Ryser 1998). Further-more, root length does not always respond to specific ions, such as nitrate or phosphate, in manner like theories based on the mobility of these ions would predict (Robinson 1996; Leyser and Fitter 1998). In this issue, Hill et al. (2006) describe an ele-gant experiment to tackle this mystery. They investigate the variation in specific root length and root surface area in response to variation in N and P supply among 10 temperate pasture species with contrasting root morphologies and contrast-ing N and P requirements. They investigate the traits contributing to variation in root surface area: biomass allocation to roots, SRL, root fineness and tissue mass density. The results show that the root morphology of a species indeed corresponds well with its phosphorus require-ments. The data also clearly illustrate the general importance of phenotypic plasticity for the maintenance of resource acquisition capacity at low levels of the resource, as all species were able to maintain a fairly constant root length across a wide range of P treatments, despite a large vari-ation in total plant mass and root mass. However, the degree of the plastic response was not related to the P uptake capacity of the species, and the patterns cannot readily be generalized. In response to P limitation, some species changed their biomass allocation pattern, some changed root fineness, and others root tissue mass density. There was no consistent relationship in the nutrient level at which the species began to modify their root characteristics and their nutri-ent requirement.},

Response variables included aboveground and belowground biomass, shoot density, space Occupation and porewater nutrients.

Richness effects were species-specific and only increased the biomass production of P. perfoliatus and tuber production of P. filiformis, while species composition generally had a stronger effect on biomass production. Additive partitioning indicated a positive complementarity effect for the aboveground biomass production in bicultures in general, while a positive net effect was found in the P. perfoliatus and P. filiformis biculture. Despite the absence of significant results for other treatments and plant variables, a trend of positive complementarity and negative selection effects were present.

abstract = {Carefully designed green roofs have the potential to be used as mitigation for habitats lost at ground level. The development of plant assemblages on two green roofs designed to emulate diverse brownfield habitats (brown roofs), by using recycled demolition aggregate as part of a low-fertility growth substrate, were studied over the first four years of their development. The cover-abundance of flowering plants and habitat structural components (e.g. bare ground, moss) were measured on the Domin-Krajina scale within all identified microhabitats. Drought disturbance was one of the main controlling factors on assemblage development. Annual plants were abundant and successful in the first growth season, and thereafter only re-appeared in any numbers following drought disturbances in subsequent years. Moss and Sedum acre L. increased through the study period until these plants dominated coverage. The cover-abundance of perennial wildflower species was strongly influenced by drought disturbance. The influence of drought disturbance varied between different brown roof microhabitats, with plant assemblages in coarser and less fertile microhabitats more resistant to these disturbances. Observed responses to drought were consistent with the following two hypotheses: (i) Areas of coarse substrate can act as disturbance refugia for plants during drought by helping preserve pockets of water under large clasts and within absorbent materials such as brick. (ii) The plant assemblages living in areas of more fertile substrates, which grow more luxuriantly when water availability is high, are more vulnerable to drought disturbance. Green roofs should be designed to include a range of substrate types to create several microhabitats that will collectively support more species than any single microhabitat. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

abstract = {Previous studies on biodiversity and soil food web composition have mentioned plant species identity, as well as plant species diversity as the main factors affecting the abundance and diversity of soil organisms. However, most studies have been carried out under limitations of time, space, or appropriate controls. In order to further examine the relation between plant species diversity and the soil food web, we conducted a threeyear semi-field experiment in which eight plant species (4 forb and 4 grass species) were grown in monocultures and mixtures of two, four and eight plant species. In addition there were communities with 16 plant species. We analyzed the abundance and identity of the nematodes in soil and roots, including feeding groups from various trophic levels (primary and secondary consumers, carnivores, and omnivores) in the soil food web. Plant species diversity and plant identity affected the diversity of nematodes. The effect of plant diversity was attributed to the complementarity in resource quality of the component plant species rather than to an increase in total resource quantity. The nematode diversity varied more between the different plant species than between different levels of plant species diversity, so that plant identity is more important than plant diversity. Nevertheless the nematode diversity in plant mixtures was higher than in any of the plant monocultures, due to the reduced dominance of the most abundant nematode taxa in the mixed plant communities. Plant species identity affected the abundances of the lower trophic consumer levels more than the higher trophic levels of nematodes. Plant species diversity and plant biomass did not affect nematode abundance. Our results, therefore, support the hypothesis that resource quality is more important than resource quantity for the diversity of soil food web components and that plant species identity is more important than plant diversity per se.},

abstract = {Algae-derived biocrude oil is a possible renewable energy alternative to fossil fuel based crude oil. Outdoor cultivation in raceway ponds is estimated to provide a better return on energy invested than closed photobioreactor systems. However, in these open systems, algal crops are subjected to environmental variation in temperature and irradiance, as well as biotic invasions which can cause costly crop instabilities. In this paper, we used an experimental approach to investigate the ability of species richness to maximize and stabilize biocrude production in the face of weekly temperature fluctuations between 17 and 27 degrees C, relative to a constant-temperature control. We hypothesized that species richness would lead to higher mean biocrude production and greater stability of biocrude production over time in the variable temperature environment. Counter to our hypothesis, species richness tended to cause a decline in mean biocrude production, regardless of environmental temperature variation. However, biodiversity did have stabilizing effects on biocrude production over time in the variable temperature environment and not in the constant temperature environment. Altogether, our results suggest that when the most productive and stable monoculture is unknown, inoculating raceway ponds with a diverse mixture of algae will tend to ensure stable harvests over time.},

abstract = {Environmental filtering, where the environment selects against certain species, is thought to be a major mechanism structuring communities. However, recent criticisms cast doubt on our ability to accurately infer filtering because competition can give rise to patterns identical to those caused by environmental filtering. While experiments can distinguish mechanisms, observational patterns are especially problematic. The environment determines community composition not only directly via survival, but also by influencing competition. If species population growth rates covary with environmental gradients, then outcomes of competitive exclusion will also vary with the environment. Here, we argue that observational studies remain valuable, but inferences about the importance of the environment cannot rely on compositional data alone, and that species abundances, population growth, or traits must be correlated with the environment.},

abstract = {Most experimental biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research to date has addressed herbaceous plant communities. Comparably little is known about how forest com- munities will respond to species losses, despite their importance for global biogeochemical cycling. We studied tree species interactions in experimental subtropical tree communities with 33 distinct tree species mixtures and one, two, or four species. Plots were either exposed to natural light levels or shaded. Trees grew rapidly and were intensely competing above ground after 1.5 growing seasons when plots were thinned and the vertical distribution of leaves and wood determined by separating the biomass of harvested trees into 50 cm height increments. Our aim was to analyze effects of species richness in relation to the vertical allocation of leaf biomass and wood, with an emphasis on bipartite competitive interactions among species. Aboveground productivity increased with species richness. The community- level vertical leaf and wood distribution depended on the species composition of communities. Mean height and breadth of species- level vertical leaf and wood distributions did not change with species rich- ness. However, the extra biomass produced by mixtures compared to monocultures of the component species increased when vertical leaf distributions of monocultures were more differ- ent. Decomposition of biodiversity effects with the additive partitioning scheme indicated pos- itive complementarity effects that were higher in light than in shade. Selection effects did not deviate from zero, irrespective of light levels. Vertical leaf distributions shifted apart in mixed stands as consequence of competition- driven phenotypic plasticity, promoting realized com- plementarity. Structural equation models showed that this effect was larger for species that differed more in growth strategies that were characterized by functional traits. In 13 of the 18 investigated two- species mixtures, both species benefitted relative to intraspecific competition in monoculture. In the remaining five pairwise mixtures, the relative yield gain of one species exceeded the relative yield loss of the other species, resulting in a relative yield total (RYT) exceeding 1. Overall, our analysis indicates that richness–productivity relationships are pro- moted by interspecific niche complementarity at early stages of stand development, and that this effect is enhanced by architectural plasticity.},

abstract = {Recent empirical studies have shown that genetic factors can influence the invasion success of alien species. Like species diversity, higher genetic diversity can increase plant performance or invasion success via selection effects or complementarity effects. The latter have also been referred to as non-additive effects because in this case individual genotypes show a different performance in mixtures than in monocultures. Based on a manipulation experiment in the field, a recent study found that such non-additive effects of genotype mixing become stronger over time in an invasive plant, probably due to higher resource uptake or facilitation between genotypes. Other researchers criticized this interpretation because in their view complementarity or non-additive effects should lead to transgressive over-performance which could not occur based on selection effects alone, where simply differences of performance between genotypes would enhance the invasion ability of multiple-genotype patches. In a commentary paper we applied Monte Carlo permutation and Loreau and Hector's additive partitioning to two datasets and found that although transgressive over-performance cannot occur due to only selection effects and thus is the most stringent test for the existence of complementarity effects, complementarity effects also commonly occur without transgressive over-performance.},

However, the effects of one plant species on coexisting plant species with regard to mycorrhizal colonization are not well understood. We examined root mycorrhizal colonization and phosphorus (P) acquisition of plants in a highly P-limiting soil in Lanxi city, Zhejiang, China from the year 2000 to 2002. Three dominant native plant species with different mycorrhizal properties, Digitaria ciliaris (poorly mycorrhizal species), Ixeris denticulate (moderately mycorrhizal species) and Kummerowia striata (highly mycorrhizal species), were planted in experimental plots. In the monocultures, K. striata was found to have the highest infection and D. ciliaris the lowest mycorrhizal infection, but shoot P-concentration was higher in both I. denticulate and D. ciliaris than that in K. striata. In the mixtures, D. ciliaris and I. denticulate did not significantly affect the mycorrhizal colonization, spore production and shoot P-concentration of K. striata plants, but K. striata and I. denticulate significantly increased root mycorrhizal colonization and shoot P-concentration of D. ciliaris. K. striata enhanced but D. ciliaris reduced mycorrhizal infection and shoot P-concentration of I. denticulate. These results suggested that highly mycorrhizal plant species may positively impact coexisting species with respect to mycorrhizal colonization and P acquisition, but the effects on poorly mycorrhizal species are less predictable. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A bioretention system receiving water from a light industrial catchment and a busy road was designed, built and monitored for changes in soil physics as well as hydrological and hydrochemical efficiency. The soils in the bioretention system were designed to have high metal removal potential and high permeability to compensate for undersized bioretention volume. The inflow hydrograph was a series of sharp peaks with little baseflow, typical of runoff from impervious surfaces. The bioretention system smoothed the hydrograph by reducing peak flow and volume for all 12 events monitored in detail. Overflow occurred in 10 events indicating the increased permeability did not fully compensate for the undersized volume. Runoff was heavily polluted with sediment and heavy metals, in particular zinc. The majority of the zinc, lead and Total Suspended Sediments were removed from the stormwater that flowed through the bioretention system, with TSS and total zinc concentrations reducing by orders of magnitude. Despite high removal efficiency, median concentrations of zinc exiting the bioretention system still exceeded ecosystem health guidelines and the bioretention system was both a source and sink of copper. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Plant diversity has profound effects on primary production. Plant diversity has been shown to correlate with increased primary production in nutrient-limited grassland ecosystems. This overyielding has been attributed to vertical niche differentiation among species below-ground, allowing for complementarity in resource capture. However, a rigorous test of this longstanding hypothesis is lacking because roots of different species could not be distinguished in diverse communities. 2. Here, we present the first application of a DNA-based technique that quantifies species abundances in multispecies root samples. We were thus able to compare root distributions in monocultures of two grasses and two forbs with root distributions in four-species mixtures. In order to investigate if vertical niche differentiation is driven by soil nutrient depletion, the topsoil layer of the communities were either nutrient-rich or -poor. 3. Immediately in the first year, 40{\%} more root biomass was produced in mixtures than expected from the monocultures, together with significant below-ground complementarity effects, probably preceding above-ground overyielding. This below-ground overyielding appeared not to be the result of vertical niche differentiation, as rooting depth of the community tended to decrease, rather than increase in mixtures compared to monocultures. Roots thus tended to clump in the very dense topsoil layer rather than segregate over the whole profile in mixtures. The below-ground overyielding was mainly driven by enhanced root investments of one species, Anthoxanthum odoratum, in the densely rooted topsoil layer without retarding the growth of the other species. 4. Synthesis. Conventional ecological mechanisms, such as competition for nutrients, do not seem to be able to explain the increased root investments of A. odoratum in mixtures compared to monocultures, with apparently little effect on the root growth of the other species. Instead, the observed root responses are consistent with species-specific root recognition responses. From a community perspective, the observed early below-ground overyielding may initiate the recently reported increased soil organic matter, mineralization and N availability and thus may ultimately be responsible for the higher productivity at high plant species diversity.},

abstract = {1. For experiments that link manipulated biodiversity to ecosystem function (EF), phylogenetic diversity (PD) has been an especially powerful form of biodiversity that explains variation in EF. PD represents the total amount of evolutionary history or genetic changes represented by a suite of species and potentially the total accumulation of species niche and functional differences. Analyses often use PD in linear models and assume that ecological differences are proportional to phylogenetic distances. Yet, it is unclear whether alternative models of evolutionary change would improve both the statistical fit and conceptual understanding of how PD influences EF. 2. Here, I use a PD–EF relationship and systematically alter models of evolution including changes in the rate of evolution from phylogenetic root–to-tip and constancy of evolutionary rate across clades. I also compare the PD–EF relationship to several randomization procedures that sequentially remove aspects of the observed phylogeny. 3. I show that changing edge lengths with evolutionary models does not strongly affect PD– EF relationships. Moreover, the observed relationship was not substantially different than the explanation provided by a phylogenetic tree with edge lengths randomized, but was significantly better than randomizations that affected the topology of the phylogenetic trees. 4. These results reveal that changes to the edge lengths have little effect on PD–EF relationships, and it is the topology that really matters. Further, placing species in their correct phylogenetic positions is much more important than developing better estimates of edge lengths.},

abstract = {Two primary approaches to perennial biofuel crop production studied so far are fertilized grass monocultures and low-input high-diversity grasslands. While high-yielding perennial grass varieties are being developed in fertilized monocultures, breeding for yield in low-input high-diversity systems would be difficult. Before initiating breeding for low-input systems, it is therefore important to know the minimum number of functional groups and species required for maximum biomass harvest from low-input grasslands. We controlled the number of perennial grassland species in 168 plots in Minnesota, USA. Species were selected at random from a pool of 18, and 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 were planted in each plot. Aboveground biomass was measured annually, and the plots were burned each spring. We found a strongly positive log-linear relationship between average annual aboveground biomass and planted species number, but a large proportion of plot-to-plot variability remained unexplained. We performed a conditional analysis of the aboveground biomass data to determine whether considering species identity would reduce the minimum number of species necessary in order to achieve yields similar to the highest diversity treatments. A model that accounted for the presence of legumes in general, and for the presence of the legume species Lupinus perennis in particular, showed no increase in biomass yield with increased species number. Over 11 years, average yields of L. perennis/C4grass bicultures were similar to those of 16-species (maximum diversity) plots, and both were {\textgreater}200{\%} greater than the average of monocultures. Thus, under low-input conditions, the choice of the appropriate few perennial plant species for each location might result in systems with biomass yields similar to those from high-diversity systems. Because breeding biofuel crops in diverse mixtures would introduce complexity that is unwarranted in terms of maximum biomass yield, the first biofuel crop breeding programs for low-input systems are likely to accelerate progress by focusing on grass-legume bicultures. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Vegetation success on green roofs in northern climates is challenged by extreme weather conditions, especially in winter, and is influenced by season of installation and substrate fertility. Appropriate fertilization with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) can reduce winter injury for some plant species. The objectives of this study were to identify both the effect of P and K fertilizer rates on Sedum spp. survival over the first winter and the response of Sedum spp. growth to fertilizer rates when applied at installation. In a fall-installed extensive green roof system, survival, growth, and visual appearance of Sedum mats in non-fertilized plots (control) were compared with plots fertilized with 16-6-13 POLYON (R) Homogenous NPK plus Minors 3-4 month controlled-release fertilizer at 20.0 g nitrogen (N)/m(2) either alone or with additional P to total 28.8, 54.4, or 80.0 g P/m(2) or K to total 32.5, 51.6, or 70.6 g K/m(2). Sedum mats were installed on 8 Oct. 2010 and plants in all plots survived the winter and the next year. During the 2011 growing season, vegetative coverage was not significantly different among any individual fertilized treatments; however, vegetative coverage data combined for all fertilized treatments was larger than the control. Fertilized treatments also showed larger plant height and biomass after one year, taller S. acre and S. sexangulare inflorescences, increased leaf greenness, and higher visual appearance rankings compared with the control. For individual Sedum species, S. album showed the greatest coverage in P-fertilized treatments, and effects on S. acre and S. sexangulare were treatment-dependent. Application of a controlled-release N-P-K fertilizer, without additional P or K, can be used to encourage vegetative coverage, plant growth, leaf greenness, inflorescence height, and visual appearance in fall-installed extensive Sedum green roof systems.},

abstract = {Plant–soil feedbacks have been widely implicated as a driver of plant community diversity, and the coexistence prediction generated by a negative plant–soil feedback can be tested using the mutual invasibility criterion: if two populations are able to invade one another, this result is consistent with stable coexistence. We previously showed that two co-occurring Rumex species exhibit negative pairwise plant–soil feedbacks, predicting that plant–soil feedbacks could lead to their coexistence. However, whether plants are able to reproduce when at an establishment disadvantage (“invasibility”), or what drivers in the soil might correlate with this pattern, are unknown. To address these questions, we created experimental plots with heterogeneous and homogeneous soils using field-collected conditioned soils from each of these Rumex species. We then allowed resident plants of each species to establish and added invader seeds of the congener to evaluate invasibility. Rumex congeners were mutually invasible, in that both species were able to establish and reproduce in the other's resident population. Invaders of both species had twice as much reproduction in heterogeneous compared to homogeneous soils; thus the spatial arrangement of plant–soil feedbacks may influence coexistence. Soil mixing had a non-additive effect on the soil bacterial and fungal communities, soil moisture, and phosphorous availability, suggesting that disturbance could dramatically alter soil legacy effects. Because the spatial arrangement of soil patches has coexistence implications, plant–soil feedback studies should move beyond studies of mean effects of single patch types, to consider how the spatial arrangement of patches in the field influences plant communities.},

abstract = {1 Ecological and agronomic research suggests that increased crop diversity in species-poor intensive systems may improve their provision of ecosystem services. Such general predictions can have critical importance for worldwide food production and agricultural practice but are largely untested at higher levels of diversity.2 We propose new methodology for the design and analysis of experiments to quantify diversity-function relationships. Our methodology can quantify the relative strength of inter-specific interactions that contribute to a functional response, and can disentangle the separate contributions of species richness and relative abundance.3 Applying our methodology to data from a common experiment at 28 European sites, we show that the above-ground biomass of four-species mixtures (two legumes and two grasses) in intensive grassland systems was consistently greater than that expected from monoculture performance, even at high productivity levels. The magnitude of this effect generally resulted in transgressive overyielding.4 A combined analysis of first-year results across sites showed that the additional performance of mixtures was driven by the number and strength of pairwise inter-specific interactions and the evenness of the community. In general, all pairwise interactions contributed equally to the additional performance of mixtures; the grass-grass and legume-legume interactions were as strong as those between grasses and legumes.5 The combined analysis across geographical and temporal scales in our study provides a generality of interpretation of our results that would not have been possible from individual site analyses or experimentation at a single site.6 Our four-species agricultural grassland communities have proved a simple yet relevant model system for experimentation and development of methodology in diversity-function research. Our study establishes that principles derived from biodiversity research in extensive, semi-natural grassland systems are applicable in intensively managed grasslands with agricultural plant species.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems are experiencing rapid and pervasive loss of species. Understanding the consequences of species loss is critical to effectively managing 25 these systems. Over the last several years, numerous experimental manipulations of species richness have been performed, yet existing quantitative syntheses have focused on a just a subset of processes measured in experiments and, as such, have not summarized the full data available from marine systems. Here, we present the results of a meta-analysis of 174 marine experiments from 42 studies that have 30 manipulated the species richness of organisms across a range of taxa and trophic levels and analysed the consequences for various ecosystem processes (categorised as production, consumption or biogeochemical fluxes). 30 manipulated the species richness of organisms across a range of taxa and trophic levels and analysed the consequences for various ecosystem processes (categorised as production, consumption or biogeochemical fluxes). Our results show that, generally, mixtures of species tend to enhance levels of ecosystem function relative to the average component species in monoculture, but 35 have no or negative effect on functioning relative to the ‘highest-performing' species. These results are largely consistent with those from other syntheses, and extend conclusions to ecological functions that are most commonly measured in the marine realm (e.g. nutrient release from sediment bioturbation). For experiments that manipulated three or more levels of richness, we attempted to discern the functional 40 form of the BEF relationship. We found that, for response variables categorised as consumption, a power-function best described the relationship, which is also consistent with previous findings. However, we identified a linear relationship between richness and production. Combined, our results suggest that losses of species will, on average, tend to alter the functioning of marine ecosystems. We outline 45 several research frontiers that will allow us to more fully understand how, why, and when diversity may drive the functioning of marine ecosystems. Key},

abstract = {Many trees species form symbiotic associations with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which improve nutrient and water acquisition of their host. Until now it is unclear whether the species richness of ECM fungi is beneficial for tree seedling performance, be it during moist conditions or drought. We performed a pot experiment using Pinus sylvestris seedlings inoculated with four selected ECM fungi (Cenococcum geophilum, Paxillus involutus, Rhizopogon roseolus and Suillus granulatus) to investigate (i) whether these four ECM fungi, in monoculture or in species mixtures, affect growth of P. sylvestris seedlings, and (ii) whether this effect can be attributed to species number per se or to species identity. Two different watering regimes (moist vs. dry) were applied to examine the context-dependency of the results. Additionally, we assessed the activity of eight extracellular enzymes in the root tips. Shoot growth was enhanced in the presence of S. granulatus, but not by any other ECM fungal species. The positive effect of S. granulatus on shoot growth was more pronounced under moist (threefold increase) than under dry conditions (twofold increase), indicating that the investigated ECM fungi did not provide additional support during drought stress. The activity of secreted extracellular enzymes was higher in S. granulatus than in any other species. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ECM fungal species composition may affect seedling performance in terms of aboveground biomass.},

abstract = {Both the presence and diversity of plants are integral to the development and functional abilities of microbial communities within constructed wetlands (CWs). The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of different individual and paired plant species combinations on microbial community function in HSSF mesocosm CWs. Experimental systems were quadruplicated and operated as two mesocosms in series planted with Phragmites australis (X) or Phalaris arundinacea (O), giving four possible sequential combinations (XX, XO, OX, OO). Wastewater was loaded each day into position 1 mesocosm with the outflow entering position 2 mesocosm, and the corresponding position 2 mesocosm outflow representing an overall experimental system effluent. The metabolic function of the interstitial-based microbial communities within each of the 16 mesocosm pairs was assessed at a single time point in the spring (May) based on community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) gathered using Biolog{\textregistered}EcoPlates. Microbial activity and metabolic richness (number of carbon sources utilised) were found to be higher in position 1 mesocosms compared to position two. Microbial community carbon source utilisation patterns (CSUPs), overall activity and metabolic richness were similar between all mesocosms from position 1-irrespective of plant species. When assessing microbial communities in position 2 of each pairing a greater variety of CSUPs, activities and metabolic richness' could be found suggesting the sequence and choice of plant can alter the microbial community function in the HSSF mesocosms. Of particular interest were the mesocosm/plant species combinations containing Phalaris in the position 2 which led to higher overall microbial activity and richness, distinct carbon source utilisation patterns (CSUPs) and an increased utilisation of specific carbon sources further from the inlet. More specifically the XO pairings (Phragmites-Phalaris) seemed to offer the most promising overall microbial function throughout both positions 1 and 2 in series suggesting plant diversity may help enhance microbial community function, and therefore microbial based water treatment capacity. The findings also suggest that the microbial communities associated with each plant species respond differently to factors such as nutrient availability, and although not yet clearly defined, further highlights the potential for improved or tailored water treatment in CWs through selection of specific plant species and combinations. Broader microbial community function or greater activity did not correlate with improved water treatment efficiency in this study. This may have been due to the relatively low contaminant loads utilised, or the limited amount of data collected. Further study across several seasons or with higher contaminant loads is recommended.},

With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting mod-els that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4.

The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently per-formed well, with little bias. 5.

Effluent levels of total suspended solids (TSS), Al, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn were similarly low for vegetated and non-vegetated soils, with reduction to {\textless}1-12{\%} of levels in the stormwater input. N and P effluent concentrations were generally lower from vegetated than non-vegetated soils, but total N increased on average in effluent of both vegetated and non-vegetated soils relative to stormwater input. Effluent concentrations varied 2-4-fold among species for TSS, total N and P, total dissolved N (TDN), organic nitrogen and Cu, to more than 20-fold for NOx, NH4+, Mn, Pb and Fe. Species also varied markedly in pollutant removal per root mass (a means of standardising for plant size), with 18-50-fold variation among species in effluent concentrations of total P and N, TDN and organic N, to {\textgreater}150-fold variation in NOxand NH4+.

Empirical evidence has accumulated highlighting the role of soil biodiversity for the functioning of ecosystems and the provision of vital ecosystem services. How can biodiversity in soil be maintained? Recent plant diversity experiments, intercropping approaches, and monitoring studies suggest that plant diversity is a crucial determinant of soil biodiversity, underlining the saying ‘biodiversity begets biodiversity'. While local plant diversity is likely to mainly increase the spatial heterogeneity of organic inputs into the soil, a review paper in this issue utilizes a meta-analysis to investigate temporal plant diversity effects on soil microbial diversity: Venter and colleagues (2016) compared crop monocultures with crop rotations and studied microbial diversity. Across studies, they found significantly higher microbial diversity in crop rotation than in crop monocultures providing some of the first synthetic empirical evidence of the beneficial effects of temporal heterogeneity in plant inputs into the soil for soil microorganisms. Future studies should investigate how ‘spatial and temporal plant diversity' effects on soil biodiversity translate into ecosystem services on which humankind relies.},

abstract = {Plastic changes in the growth and productivity of algae in response to environment and stocking density are well established. In contrast, the capacity for such changes to persist once environmental differences cease, potentially signalling an evolutionary response, have rarely been tested for algae in intensive production systems. We tested whether continuous differences in harvesting regime (a high stocking density/low-yield regime versus low stocking density/high-yield regime) generated changes in biomass productivity and other growth metrics within several strains of the clonal macroalga Oedogonium (Chlorophyta, Oedogoniales) and whether such changes persisted once differential harvesting yields ceased. We found considerable plasticity in growth rate and biomass productivity over a 12-week period of active selection (i.e. repeated high-yield and low-yield harvesting of clonal lineages within strains) and that strains responded differently to this selection pressure over time. While small, but significant, differences in growth rates of clonal lineages exposed to high-yield vs low-yield harvesting regimes were maintained after prolonged culture under a common selection regime (i.e. medium-yield harvesting), differences in biomass productivity were not. There was no evidence for positive or negative effects of maintaining multiple strains in polyculture on growth and biomass productivity. Overall, we detected limited potential for evolutionary responses to harvesting regime in the main commercial trait of interest—biomass productivity. This outcome is important for commercial cultivation in intensive production systems, since it identifies a low risk that harvesting practices will impact negatively on biomass productivity in the longer term.},

It showed that the extent of the area with a high environmental load could be reduced from 19{\%} to 2{\%} of the total. Furthermore, bio-ecological surveys underlined the need for the development of green roof concepts at the scale of the town. The wide range of vegetation found on green roofs and the variety of designs available provides examples of ecological compensation that can be varied according to the natural and social surroundings.},

abstract = {Mixed forests are thought to be less prone to pest insect damage than monocultures. This may result from reduced host availability (i.e., density effect) or from non-host trees reducing the physical or chemical apparency of host trees (i.e., associational resistance, AR). However, associational and density effects are often confounded in mixed forests. We aimed to disentangle their relative contribution to attacks of pine trees by a specialist pest, the pine processionary moth (PPM, Thaumetopoea pityocampa). We assessed pine infestation by PPM by counting the number of winter nests during three consecutive years along an experimental gradient of pine density in presence or absence of a fast growing species, namely birch. The total number of PPM nests per plot increased with pine density (maximum in high density monocultures), while the proportion of attacked pine trees decreased along the same gradient. Birch provided associational resistance via reduced pine apparency due to their greatest higher. This mechanism occurred at two spatial scales, whenever birch was planted within pine plots or in adjacent plots. Associational resistance was stronger in dense stands, probably due to reduced distance between pines and neighboring birches. But AR faded with time, pines becoming taller than birches, making density effects preeminent over apparency effects. Our findings suggest that mixing tree species to trigger resistance to pest insects requires taking into account the relative growth rate of associated species together with the relative proportion of associated species, both within and between stands.},

abstract = {Plant–soil feedbacks can have important implications for the interactions among plants. Understanding these effects is a major challenge since it is inherently difficult to measure and manipulate highly diverse soil communities. Mathematical models may advance this understanding by making the interplay of the various processes affecting plant–soil interaction explicit and by quantifying the relative importance of the factors involved. The aim of this paper is to provide a complete analysis of a pioneering plant–soil feedback model developed by Bever and colleagues (J Ecol 85: 561–573, 1997; Ecol Lett 2: 52–62, 1999; New Phytol 157: 465–473, 2003) to fully understand the range of possible impacts of plant–soil feedbacks on plant communities within this framework. We analyze this model by means of a new graphical method that provides a complete classification of the potential effects of soil communities on plant competition. Due to the graphical character of the method, the results are relatively easy to obtain and understand. We show that plant diversity depends crucially on two key parameters that may be viewed as measures of the intensity of plant competition and the direction and strength of plant– soil feedback, respectively. Our analysis provides a formal underpinning of earlier claims that plant–soil feedbacks, especially when they are negative, may enhance the diversity of plant communities. In particular, negative plant–soil feedbacks can enhance the range of plant coexistence by inducing competitive oscillations. However, these oscillations can also destabilize plant coexistence, leading to low population densities and extinctions. In addition, positive feedbacks can allow locally stable forms of plant coexistence by inducing alternative stable states. Our findings highlight that the inclusion of plant–soil interactions may fundamentally alter the predictions on the structure and functioning of above-ground ecosystems. The scenarios presented in this study can be used to formulate hypotheses about the ways soil community effects may influence plant competition that can be tested with empirical studies. This will advance our understanding of the role of plant–soil feedback in ecological communities.},

abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly adopting an evolutionary perspective, and in recent years, the idea that closely related species are ecologically similar has become widespread. In this regard, phylogenetic signal must be distinguished from phylogenetic niche conservatism. Phylogenetic niche conservatism results when closely related species are more ecologically similar that would be expected based on their phylogenetic relationships; its occurrence suggests that some process is constraining divergence among closely related species. In contrast, phylogenetic signal refers to the situation in which ecological similarity between species is related to phylogenetic relatedness; this is the expected outcome of Brownian motion divergence and thus is necessary, but not sufficient, evidence for the existence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Although many workers consider phylogenetic niche conservatism to be common, a review of case studies indicates that ecological and phylogenetic similarities often are not related. Consequently, ecologists should not assume that phylogenetic niche conservatism exists, but rather should empirically examine the extent to which it occurs.},
annote = {Intro:
- ecologists are adopting an evolutionary perspective; e.g. compare the degree of phylogenetic relatedness of community members to that of speices source pools 
- a common method is incoporating the idea that closely related species are ecologically similar; two different apporaches
(1) phylogenetic signals - characters evolve under BM models; time since divergence is correlated with degree of phenotypic similarity 
(2) phylogenetic niche conservatism - some factor is causing closely related species to more ecologically similar than by random chance (BM models)
- goal of paper is to clarify the difference between phylogenetic signal and PNC

What is PNC?
- observation that related species differ less ecologically than might be expected if ecological diversification had occured in an unconstrained manner

How prevalent are PNC and Phylo-signals?
- two approaches to documet PNC
(1) detection of old clades that show little ecological variation among species 
(2) statistical approach -
for PNC to occur, phylogenetic signal would have be even greater than expected to result from Brownian motion
(3) documentation of phylogenetic signal is necessary, but not sufficient, to demonstrate PNC - lack of phylo signal is enough to say that PNC doesn't exist
(4) mixed results in how phenotypic similarity is linked to ecological similarity; possible to use morphological characters as surrogates for ecological vairation
(5) phylogenetic signal show s up in some clades, but not others 

What does this all mean?
- researchers should collect requisite ecological data, and test whether ecological similairty among species is statistically associated with phylogentic relatedness
- phylogenetic composition of communities is not possible without actual ecological data for the constituent species; hard to interpret clustering/overdispersion (closely-related species can still be ecological divergent)
- any situation that promotes convergent evolution among extant species is likely to lead to little or no phylogentic signal

Sampling, scale and phylogenetic signal
- community vs clade perspective
(1) competitive exclusion may lead to distantly related species (diminishes PNC)
(2) closely related species may diverge ecologically in sympatry to minimize resource overlap (diminishes phylogenetic signal)
(3) suites of distantly related species convergently adapted to the same ecological conditions

Phylogenetic scale
- signal may be revealed if phylogenetic scale is greatly expanded
- but, a greater phylo scale may decrease PNC if between-clade convergence has occured
- sampling should be random and ideally as complete as possible to get an unbiased estimated

PNC: pattern or process
- pattern: historical patterns manifests on a phylogeny; a descrition of what happened, but not a statement on how it happened.},

abstract = {Biological invasions and climate warming are two major threats to the world's biodiversity. To date, their impacts have largely been considered independently, despite indications that climate warming may increase the success of many invasive alien species. We therefore set up an experiment to study competition between native and invasive alien plant species and the effects of climate warming thereon. Two highly invasive alien plant species in Belgium, each with a native competitor that dominated in invaded sites, were grown either together (1:1 mixtures) or in isolation (monocultures) at ambient and elevated temperature (+3°C) in climate-controlled chambers. To detect possible mechanisms underlying the effects of competition and elevated temperature, we conducted a combined growth and nitrogen uptake analysis. In one pair, Senecio inaequidens – Plantago lanceolata (alien invasive – native), the alien species dominated in mixture, while in the other pair, Solidago gigantea – Epilobium hirsutum, the native species dominated. Climate warming reduced the invader dominance in the first species pair, but stimulated the suppressed invader in the latter. Many of the biomass responses for these two species pairs could be traced to the root-specific nitrogen uptake capacity. The responses of the native-invasive interaction to warming could not always be extrapolated from the monoculture responses, pointing to the necessity for experiments that take into account species interactions.},

abstract = {The population density of the diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (L.), the species diversity of its predators, parasitism on eggs, larvae and pupae, and associated yield of canola were evaluated in experimental plots where spring canola was grown either as a monoculture or strip-intercropped with annual alfalfa in the ratio of 3C:3A, 6C:3A and 9C:3A over a 2-year period. The egg density was significantly higher in monoculture than in intercrops. The highest and lowest densities of larvae and pupae of DBM were recorded in monoculture (2.9–3.2 larvae per plant and 1.14–1.20 pupae per plant) and intercrop 3C:3A (0.7–0.6 larvae per plant and 0.34–0.29 pupae per plant), respectively. Shannon diversity index ( H' ) for species composition of the predators of DBM immature stages was lower in monoculture than in intercrops, and was similar amongst the three intercrops. Moreover, the percent parasitism for eggs, larvae and pupae was higher in intercrops than in monoculture. The dry seed weight loss was higher in monocrop (37.6–40.1{\%}) compared to 3C:3A (7.9–8.6{\%}), 6C:3A (19.5–21.4{\%}) and 9C:3A (21.6–25.4{\%}). Our results indicate that intercropping canola with annual alfalfa, especially in the ratio 3C:3A, can increase the species diversity, parasitism rates of DBM immature stages, and enhance the yield of canola. The implications of these findings, in relation to integrated pest management (IPM) in canola cropping systems, are discussed.},

abstract = {* The maintenance of habitat heterogeneity in agricultural landscapes has been promoted as a key strategy to conserve biodiversity. Animal response to grassland heterogeneity resulting from spatiotemporal variation in disturbance is well documented; however, the degree to which edaphic variation generates heterogeneity detectable by grassland wildlife has proven more difficult to study in natural settings. * We conducted a field experiment to study how soils directly affect vegetation structure and composition and indirectly affect bird and butterfly assemblages using plantings of tallgrass prairie species managed as agroenergy crops in Iowa, USA. The experimental design included four vegetation treatments of varying species richness replicated on three soil types. * Habitat characteristics varied widely among soils. Crops on sandy loam, the driest, most acidic soil with the lowest nutrient content, developed shorter, less dense vegetation with sparse litter accumulation and more bare ground compared to crops on loam and clay loam. * Birds and butterflies responded similarly to soil-induced variation in habitat characteristics. Their abundance and species richness were similar on all soils, but their assemblage compositions varied among soils in certain vegetation treatments. * In low-diversity grass crops, bird assemblages using sandy loam were dominated by species preferring open ground and sparse vegetation for foraging and nesting, whereas assemblages using loam and clay loam were dominated by birds preferring tall, dense vegetation with abundant litter. In high-diversity prairie crops, the species composition of forbs in bloom varied among soils and strongly influenced butterfly assemblages. * Synthesis and applications. Prairie agroenergy crops established with identical management practices developed variable habitat characteristics due to natural edaphic variation, and this heterogeneity influenced the spatial distribution of bird and butterfly assemblages due to differential habitat use among species. This finding suggests that if unfertilized prairie crops were grown for agroenergy by land managers large-scale, soil-induced habitat heterogeneity would promote wildlife diversity within and among fields, further increasing the habitat value of these crops compared to the fertilized, annual monocultures that currently dominate the agricultural landscape. Our study also highlights the need for managers to consider soil properties when selecting sites to restore grassland habitat for species of conservation concern.},

abstract = {To develop a better understanding of how biodiversity loss and productivity are related, we need to consider ecologically realistic rarity (i.e. reduced evenness and increased dominance) and extinction (i.e. reduced richness) scenarios. Furthermore, we need to identify and better understand the factors that influence species and community yielding behaviors because the general conditions for overyielding are the same as those for coexistence. We established experimental tallgrass prairie plots in Iowa to determine how two ecologically realistic rarityextinction scenarios influenced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and disassembly. Equal-mass seedlings of six tallgrass prairie species were transplanted into field plots to establish realistic declining species evenness (high, medium, low) and richness (4, 1) treatments. Across declining evenness treatments, the relative abundance of the ubiquitous tall species Andropogon gerardii increased, the relative abundance of the tall species Salvia azurea was constant, and the relative abundance of two short (dissimilar height scenario) or two tall species (tall scenario) decreased. Monocultures of Andropogon represented a continuation of this trend until there was complete dominance by Andropogon and extinction of all other species. Our treatments also allowed us to test if variation in plant height contributes to the complementarity effect. Niche partitioning in plant height was not positively related to complementarity. The effects of declining species evenness and richness on the diversityproductivity relationship were different for these two ecologically realistic rarityextinction scenarios. Specifically, as diversity declined across treatments, ANPP and the selection effects decreased in tall communities, but not in dissimilar communities. Additionally, differences between these two scenarios revealed that decreased species yielding behavior is associated with two tallgrass prairie extinction risk factors, rarity and short height. The differences between these scenarios demonstrate the importance of incorporating the known patterns of diversity declines into future studies.},

In spite of the existing warming trend, climate change models forecast high variability, including freezing temperatures. As the potato center of origin, the region has a rich biodiversity which includes a set of frost resistant genotypes. Four contrasting potato genotypes--representing genetic variability--were considered in the present study: two species of frost resistant native potatoes (the bitter Solanum juzepczukii, var. Luki, and the non-bitter Solanum ajanhuiri, var. Ajanhuiri) and two commercial frost susceptible genotypes (Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum var. Alpha and Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigenum var. Gendarme). The objective of the study was to conduct a comparative growth analysis of four genotypes and modeling their agronomic response under frost events. It included assessing their performance under Andean contrasting agroecological conditions. Independent subsets of data from four field experiments were used to parameterize, calibrate and validate a potato growth model. The validated model was used to ascertain the importance of biodiversity, represented by the four genotypes tested, as constituents of germplasm mixtures in single plots used by local farmers, a coping strategy in the face of climate variability. Also scenarios with a frost routine incorporated in the model were constructed. Luki and Ajanhuiri were the most frost resistant varieties whereas Alpha was the most susceptible. Luki and Ajanhuiri, as monoculture, outperformed the yield obtained with the mixtures under severe frosts. These results highlight the role played by local frost tolerant varieties, and featured the management importance--e.g. clean seed, strategic watering--to attain the yields reported in our experiments. The mixtures of local and introduced potatoes can thus not only provide the products demanded by the markets but also reduce the impact of frosts and thus the vulnerability of the system to abiotic stressors.},

In this paper, I examine the best practises in nest box material selection and construction, and the use of nest boxes to address four basic objectives related to our understanding of bee biology and enhancement of pollination services. A variety of materials and cavity dimensions are included in nest boxes that are used to monitor local bee diversity or to address fundamental questions in community ecology and environmental change. Others examine bee biology, physiology and behaviour that use nest boxes to obtain bees for further experimentation. The majority of studies use nest boxes in agricultural landscapes and in alternative pollinator management; these studies improve nest box design for target bee species to augment their numbers. Continued design and data sharing, as well as the refinement of nest box construction and deployment for specific objectives, will ensure they remain useful tools for bee science, conservation and alternative pollinator management.},

abstract = {In the debate on the influence of declining plant diversity on ecosystem functioning, spatial aggregation has received little attention, in spite of the fact that the local distribution of species determines interaction. Using a simple conceptual model, we visualize the effect that clumping has on below ground resource uptake (RU). Two general conclusions can be drawn from the model: (1) clumping results in a loss of RU, and does so to a larger extent when species differ more in rooting depth and when plant density increases; (2) the current view on complementarity may be flawed, as we find that neighborhood species richness only promotes spatial complementarity directly at the transition from monocultures to higher species richness levels, but not at transitions between higher richness levels. The number of species in a community does, however, affect the probability of the occurrence of clumping. In randomly assembled communities, clumps are statistically larger when the number of species is lower, leading to reduced overall below ground complementarity. Complementarity, and thus also RU, will therefore increase indirectly with increasing species richness. As a result of our findings, we propose that clumping could have a number of 'hidden' consequences, for example on invasibility of a community and on competition between species. Clumping could also prove to be a new and important explanatory factor in diversity studies, as it extends the definition of complementarity effects to include the effect of spatial heterogeneity of plant positions within the community.},

abstract = {This review summarizes the microbial mechanisms responsible for removal of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur compounds in treatment wetlands (TWs) and identifies, categorizes and compares various techniques, from plate count to more modern genomic methods used to elucidate these mechanisms. Removal of a particular pollutant is typically associated with a specific microbial functional group, therefore employment of design and operational methodologies that enhance the activity of that group will better optimize performance. Redox condition is a manipulable parameter that can be used to optimize growth of a targeted functional group, therefore factors influencing the TW redox condition and its influence on organic carbon removal mechanisms are emphasized. Environmental factors influencing growth and activity of N and S cycling microbes (including temperature, pH, salinity, plant species selection and availability of organic carbon and/or inhibiting substances) are discussed with particular attention to factors that might be manipulated. This information is used to offer design and operational methodologies that might enhance growth of a desirable microbial functional group and project what additional microbially-focused research is required to better optimize TW performance. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intercropping systems could increase crop diversity and avoid vulnerability to biotic stresses. Most studies have shown that intercropping can provide relief to crops against wind-dispersed pathogens. However, there was limited data on how the practice of intercropping help crops against soil-borne Phytophthora disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to pepper monoculture, a large scale intercropping study of maize grown between pepper rows reduced disease levels of the soil-borne pepper Phytophthora blight. These reduced disease levels of Phytophthora in the intercropping system were correlated with the ability of maize plants to form a "root wall" that restricted the movement of Phytophthora capsici across rows. Experimentally, it was found that maize roots attracted the zoospores of P. capsici and then inhibited their growth. When maize plants were grown in close proximity to each other, the roots produced and secreted larger quantities of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA) and 6-methoxy-2-benzoxazolinone (MBOA). Furthermore, MBOA, benzothiazole (BZO), and 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole (MBZO) were identified in root exudates of maize and showed antimicrobial activity against P. capsici.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Maize could form a "root wall" to restrict the spread of P. capsici across rows in maize and pepper intercropping systems. Antimicrobe compounds secreted by maize root were one of the factors that resulted in the inhibition of P. capsici. These results provide new insights into plant-plant-microbe mechanisms involved in intercropping systems.},

abstract = {1. The subdiscipline of 'community phylogenetics' is rapidly growing and influencing thinking regarding community assembly. In particular, phylogenetic dispersion of co-occurring species within a community is commonly used as a proxy to identify which community assembly pro-cesses may have structured a particular community: phylogenetic clustering as a proxy for abi-otic assembly, that is habitat filtering, and phylogenetic overdispersion as a proxy for biotic assembly, notably competition. 2. We challenge this approach by highlighting (typically) implicit assumptions that are, in reality, only weakly supported, including (i) phylogenetic dispersion reflects trait dispersion; (ii) a given ecological function can be performed only by a single trait state or combination of trait states; (iii) trait similarity causes enhanced competition; (iv) competition causes species exclusion; (v) commu-nities are at equilibrium with processes of assembly having been completed; (vi) assembly through habitat filtering decreases in importance if assembly through competition increases, such that the relative balance of the two can be thus quantified by a single parameter; and (vii) observed phylo-genetic dispersion is driven predominantly by local and present-day processes. 3. Moreover, technical sophistication of the phylogenetic-patterns-as-proxy approach trades off against sophistication in alternative, potentially more pertinent approaches to directly observe or manipulate assembly processes. 4. Despite concerns about using phylogenetic dispersion as a proxy for community assembly processes, we suggest there are underappreciated benefits of quantifying the phylogenetic structure of communities, including (i) understanding how coexistence leads to the macro-evolutionary diversification of habitat lineage-pools (i.e. phylogenetic-patterns-as-result approach); and (ii) understanding the macroevolutionary contingency of habitat lineage-pools and how it affects present-day species coexistence in local communities (i.e. phylogenetic-patterns-as-cause approach). 5. We conclude that phylogenetic patterns may be little useful as proxy of community assembly. However, such patterns can prove useful to identify and test novel hypotheses on (i) how local coexistence may control macroevolution of the habitat lineage-pool, for example through com-petition among close relatives triggering displacement and diversification of characters, and (ii) how macroevolution within the habitat lineage-pool may control local coexistence of related species, for example through origin of close relatives that can potentially enter in competition.},

abstract = {Resource partitioning, facilitation, and sampling effect are the three mechanisms behind the biodiversity effect, which is depicted usually as the effect of plant-species richness on aboveground net primary production. These mechanisms operate simultaneously but their relative importance and interactions are difficult to unravel experimentally. Thus, niche differentiation and facilitation have been lumped together and separated from the sampling effect. Here, we propose three hypotheses about interactions among the three mechanisms and test them using a simulation model. The model simulated water movement through soil and vegetation, and net primary production mimicking the Patagonian steppe. Using the model, we created grass and shrub monocultures and mixtures, controlled root overlap and grass water-use efficiency (WUE) to simulate gradients of biodiversity, resource partitioning and facilitation. The presence of shrubs facilitated grass growth by increasing its WUE and in turn increased the sampling effect, whereas root overlap (resource partitioning) had, on average, no effect on sampling effect. Interestingly, resource partitioning and facilitation interacted so the effect of facilitation on sampling effect decreased as resource partitioning increased. Sampling effect was enhanced by the difference between the two functional groups in their efficiency in using resources. Morphological and physiological differences make one group outperform the other; once these differences were established further differences did not enhance the sampling effect. In addition, grass WUE and root overlap positively influence the biodiversity effect but showed no interactions.},

abstract = {1. Genotypic diversity in plant populations is known to enhance plant performance and ecosystem function. Nonetheless, the effect of genotypic diversity has rarely been examined across a population's lifecycle despite the expectation that changing conditions, such as population density, will alter the benefits of diversity. 2. We simultaneously manipulated a component of genotypic diversity (richness, the number of genotypes) and density of common evening primrose Oenothera biennis to address the consequences for herbivory and lifetime fitness in a 2-year field experiment that spanned seed germination to lifetime fruit production. We genotyped {\textgreater}1100 seedlings with microsatellite DNA markers to determine realized diversity and density in plots sown with O. biennis seeds. Our design achieved quantitative variation in plant density and diversity, with one to 44 individuals established in field plots and two to eight genotypes per polyculture plot (based on microsatellite analysis of reproductive plants). 3. We found a strong interaction between seed density and genetic diversity, with germination and establishment being 24{\%} higher in genetic polycultures than monocultures, but only at low seed density. At high seed density, the opposite pattern emerged, with polycultures having 12{\%} fewer individuals established than monocultures. Initial effects of emergence on plot density persisted through to the fruiting stage. 4. Higher plant densities resulted in increased mortality, decreased probability of reproduction, decreased plant height and lower levels of lifetime fruit production per plant. Increasing genotypic diversity increased the probability of reproduction overall and showed a significant interaction with plant density mitigating the negative effects of high density on individual height and lifetime fruit production. 5. Synthesis. Plant density and genotypic diversity interacted from the very early stages of seed germination and establishment of Oenothera biennis. This effect persisted over the 2-year life cycle of plants, and genotypic diversity buffered against the negative fitness consequences of high plant density. These results imply a dynamic interplay between the long-held paradigm of density effects in plant ecology and the genetic structure of populations.},

abstract = {Observational studies and experimental evidence agree that rising global temperatures have altered plant phenology-the timing of life events, such as flowering, germination, and leaf-out. Other large-scale global environmental changes, such as nitrogen deposition and altered precipitation regimes, have also been linked to changes in flowering times. Despite our increased understanding of how abiotic factors influence plant phenology, we know very little about how biotic interactions can affect flowering times, a significant knowledge gap given ongoing human-caused alteration of biodiversity and plant community structure at the global scale. We experimentally manipulated plant diversity in a California serpentine grassland and found that many plant species flowered earlier in response to reductions in diversity, with peak flowering date advancing an average of 0.6 days per species lost. These changes in phenology were mediated by the effects of plant diversity on soil surface temperature, available soil N, and soil moisture. Peak flowering dates were also more dispersed among species in high-diversity plots than expected based on monocultures. Our findings illustrate that shifts in plant species composition and diversity can alter the timing and distribution of flowering events, and that these changes to phenology are similar in magnitude to effects induced by climate change. Declining diversity could thus contribute to or exacerbate phenological changes attributed to rising global temperatures.},

abstract = {Ecosystem function is the outcome of species interactions, traits, and niche overlap –all of which are influenced by evolution. However, it is not well understood how the tempo and mode of niche evolution can influence ecosystem function. In evolutionary models where either species differences accumulate through random drift in a single trait or species differences accumulate through divergent selection among close relatives, we should expect that ecosystem function is strongly related to diversity. However, when strong selection causes species to converge on specific niches or when novel traits that directly affect function evolve in some clades but not others, the relationship between diversity and ecosystem function might not be very strong. We test these ideas using a field experiment that established plant mixtures with differing phylogenetic diversities and we measured ten different community functions. We show that some functions were strongly predicted by species richness and mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (MPD, a measure of phylogenetic diversity), including biomass production and the reduction of herbivore and pathogen damage in polyculture, while other functions had weaker (litter production and structural complexity) or nonsignificant relationships (e.g., flower production and arthropod abundance) with MPD and richness. However, these divergent results can be explained by different models of niche evolution. These results show that diversity-ecosystem function relationships are the product of evolution, but that the nature of how evolution influences ecosystem function is complex.},

abstract = {A majority of agricultural pests are influenced by microclimatic conditions that affect their performance and occurrence. Thermal heterogeneity experienced by pests at fine spatial scales is potentially a key to understand pest dynamics, yet its study over entire fields at fine resolution has never been performed. We used aerial infrared thermography to yield high-resolution measurements of crop canopy temperatures in 38 potato fields in the Ecuadorian Andes. In each field, for 30 different plots, we characterized the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of crop canopy temperatures and simultaneously sampled populations of four common leaf-surface dwelling adult pests. We then evaluated the fine-scale thermal heterogeneity implications for pest occurrence and compared a variety of thermal spatial metrics with pest abundance and richness measured in field. We found that the range of temperatures available for pests in crop canopies was independent on scale: pests can access within few centimetres most of the thermal microenvironments recorded at the field level. Also, the availability of thermal microenvironments was dependent on solar radiations: with increasing radiation levels, pests have to travel less distance to reach a variety of thermal environments. At the plot level, we found that the four-studied pests were not clumped into their optimal thermal conditions but rather distributed evenly. Pests having a wide range of favourable microenvironments available within very short distances might be constrained by others factors (resources, enemies). However, we found that pest richness was significantly correlated to both thermal aggregation and diversity index, suggesting that more diverse and distinctly distributed thermal environments in crop fields shelter a higher diversity of pests. As environmental conservation and agronomical management increasingly depend on our ability to understand and predict the responses of species to their environment, we recommend refining global pest distribution predictions using fine-grained microclimatic models to infer accurate responses of organism to climate change. Indeed, fine-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity of microclimates might provide organisms with more than enough suitable thermal habitats in their actual location to withstand global changes.},

abstract = {Most explanations for the positive effect of plant species diversity on productivity have focused on the efficiency of resource use, implicitly assuming that resource supply is constant. To test this assumption, we grew seedlings of Echinacea purpurea in soil collected beneath 10-year-old, experimental plant communities containing one, two, four, eight, or 16 native grassland species. The results of this greenhouse bioassay challenge the assumption of constant resource supply; we found that bioassay seedlings grown in soil collected from experimental communities containing 16 plant species produced 70{\%} more biomass than seedlings grown in soil collected beneath monocultures. This increase was likely attributable to greater soil N availability, which had increased in higher diversity communities over the 10-year-duration of the experiment. In a distinction akin to the selection/complementarity partition commonly made in studies of diversity and productivity, we further determined whether the additive effects of functional groups or the interactive effects of functional groups explained the increase in fertility with diversity. The increase in bioassay seedling biomass with diversity was largely explained by a concomitant increase in N-fixer, C4 grass, forb, and C3 grass biomass with diversity, suggesting that the additive effects of these four functional groups at higher diversity contributed to enhance N availability and retention. Nevertheless, diversity still explained a significant amount of the residual variation in bioassay seedling biomass after functional group biomass was included in a multiple regression, suggesting that interactions also increased fertility in diverse communities. Our results suggest a mechanism, the fertility effect, by which increased plant species diversity may increase community productivity over time by increasing the supply of nutrients via both greater inputs and greater retention.},

abstract = {Most ecological processes and interactions depend on scales much larger than a single habitat, and therefore it is important to link spatial patterns and ecological processes at a landscape scale. Here, we analyzed the effects of landscape context on the distribution of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) at multiple spatial scales with respect to the following hypotheses: (1) Local abundance and diversity of bees increase with increasing proportion of the surrounding seminatural habitats. (2) Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape context at different spatial scales. We selected 15 landscape sectors and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250–3000 m) by field inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic Information Systems. The percentage of semi-natural habitats varied between 1.4{\%} and 28{\%}. In the center of each landscape sector a patch of potted flowering plants (four perennial and two annual species) was placed in the same habitat type, a grassy field margin adjacent to cereal fields. In all, 865 wild bee individuals and 467 honey bees were observed and an additional 475 individuals were caught for species identification. Species richness and abundance of solitary wild bees showed a close positive correlation with the percentage of seminatural habitats at small scales up to 750 m, whereas bumble bees and honey bees did not respond to landscape context at these scales. In contrast, honey bees were correlated with landscape context at large scales. The densities of flower-visiting honey bees even increased with decreasing proportion of seminatural habitats at a radius of 3000 m. We are not aware of any empirical studies showing contrasting foraging patterns related to landscape context at different spatial scales. We conclude (1) that local landscape destruction affects solitary wild bees more than social bees, possibly changing mutualistic plant–pollinator and competitive wild bees– honey bees interactions and (2) that only analyses of multiple spatial scales may detect the importance of the landscape context for local pollinator communities.},

abstract = {In a large integrated biodiversity project (‘The Jena Experiment' in Germany) we established two experiments, one with a pool of 60 plant species that ranged broadly from dominant to subordinate competitors on large 20 × 20 m and small 3.5 × 3.5 m plots (= main experiment), and one with a pool of nine potentially dominant species on small 3.5 × 3.5 m plots (= dominance experiment). We found identical positive species richness–aboveground productivity relationships in the main experiment at both scales. This result suggests that scaling up, at least over the short term, is appropriate in interpreting the implications of such experiments for larger-scale patterns. The species richness–productivity relationship was more pronounced in the experiment with dominant species (46.7 and 82.6{\%} yield increase compared to mean monoculture, respectively). Additionally, transgressive overyielding occurred more frequently in the dominance experiment (67.7{\%} of cases) than in the main experiment (23.4{\%} of cases). Additive partitioning and relative yield total analyses showed that both complementarity and selection effects contributed to the positive net biodiversity effect.},

abstract = {Mixing different tree species in forest plantations might increase stand productivity and resilience compared to monocultures, but mixing effects in the early stage of mixed forest plantations are still poorly understood. In general, sapling growth is affected by environmental factors, sapling species identity, direct and indirect interactions with neighbouring saplings, and competition with the ground layer vegetation. We assessed the diameter increment, height increment, and height to diameter ratio of ca. 5500 permanently marked saplings growing in local neighbourhoods that differ in number and identity of the sapling species present. We found that sapling growth was related to the sapling's species identity and the characteristics of its local neighbourhood (notably phylogenetic diversity, relative size asymmetry, and ground vegetation cover). The identity of the neighbours only mattered when target and neighbour tree species differed in, for instance, light requirements. The growth of the young saplings was positively affected by tall neighbours and ground vegetation cover. This suggests that careful species selection when designing mixed forest plantations is important and that ground vegetation can be favourable for sapling growth in the first years of a new plantation.},

abstract = {Summary 1 Few experiments directly test the role of density dependence in natural plant communities. 2 We tested (i) whether different initial seed densities of the entire seed bank of an annual plant community affected performance (emergence, mean plant biomass and survival) and (ii) whether density-dependent processes were operating within the communities. We also tested whether life-stage, year and soil moisture (both on a topographic gradient and in an experimental manipulation) influenced the effects of seed density. 3 We considered two distinct phases: seed to emergent seedlings, and emergent seedlings to established plants. 4 The seed bank was collected from a semistabilized sand dune in the Negev Desert, Israel. This was added to sieved sand in plots at the same site at four different initial seed densities: 1/16x, 1/4x, 1x (natural seed density) and 2x. The experiment was repeated for three consecutive growing seasons. 5 Emergence of seedlings was significantly influenced by initial seed density in all 3 years, with higher initial seed densities having lower rates of emergence. 6 Mean final plant size was negatively density dependent and consistently unaffected by the initial seed density sown. 7 In general, there were no strong interactions of topographic position with initial seed density, processes within the vegetation were not density dependent and the experimental addition of water did not influence any of the performance measures tested. Density-dependent processes vary from year to year, while moisture effects do not. 8 We conclude that seedling emergence and some processes in the established plant community are density dependent, but the established plant community is also affected by other processes, such as resource limitation.},

Using naturally co-occurring mosses and liverworts, we constructed bryophyte communities to test relationships between species diversity (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, or 32 species) and productivity under constant conditions and when exposed to experimental drought. We found no relationship between species richness and biomass under constant conditions. However, when communities were exposed to experimental drought, biomass increased with species richness. Responses of individual species demonstrated that facilitative interactions rather than sampling effects or niche complementarity best explained results-survivorship increased for almost all species, and those species least resistant to drought in monoculture had the greatest increase in biomass. Positive interactions may be an important but previously underemphasized mechanism linking high diversity to high productivity under stressful environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Green roofs are increasingly popular in urban areas of NW Europe and North America. However, greening roofs still needs incentives particularly in countries with a Mediterranean climate. Although green roof benefits such as cooling capacity and storm water retention would be even more pronounced in this challenging climate with hot and dry summers, vegetation stress on extensive green roofs will be enhanced, causing low performance if the same species as in the temperate regions of NW Europe and North America are used. In order to support further development and application of green roofs in the Mediterranean climate, new insights on suitable native species is an essential step. Using the habitat template concept, specifically taking into account drought adaptation and self-regulation, we developed a screening procedure using both functional plant traits and utilitarian aspects. Plant traits of two species lists (one resulting from an extensive vegetation study and another one covering the successful plant species of extensive green roofs in NW Europe) were analyzed. The results were incorporated into a hierarchical multi-criteria screening tool. This tool can encourage further experimental trials and inspire and guide the green roof industry toward the most appropriate species for extensive green roof design. As an example, the key was illustrated on a subset of plant species from Mediterranean southern France, which identified 34 newly potential green roof species. Interestingly, 35{\%} of these species were annuals, a promising life form that has until now rarely been considered for extensive green roofs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Summary 1. Diversity effects on canopy structure and the use of space and light were invest-igated in experimental grassland communities of one, two, four, eight or 32 species and of one, two or three functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous forbs) in north-western Switzerland. 2. Plant species and functional group richness improved the establishment of grass-land assemblages and increased mean vegetation cover from 64{\%} in monocultures to 100{\%} in 32-species mixtures. 3. Above-ground biomass and leaf area index increased linearly with the logarithm of plant species number in all 3 years of the experiment. The most species-rich com-munities produced 143{\%} more biomass than the mean of all monocultures and 25{\%} more biomass than the most productive monoculture in the third year of the experiment. 4. Plant light absorbance per unit ground area increased by 44{\%} with diversity (32-species mixtures compared with monocultures) for two reasons. (i) The lack of species complementarity in terms of success of seedling establishment and plant size in vegeta-tion with low species diversity increased the gap area in the canopy, and consequently more light reached bare ground. (ii) Diverse ecosystems absorbed more light within their closed canopies (+20{\%}) than did less diverse ecosystems, because of better three-dimensional space filling and greater biomass density due to complementarity in plant architecture, particularly between grasses and dicots. 5. The overall canopy height was increased by 46{\%} and the centre of gravity of the canopy was raised by up to 10 cm over the range of experimental diversity treatments from one to 32 species. 6. These results cannot be explained solely by a higher likelihood of the inclusion of more productive dominant species in the more diverse communities (sampling effect), which suggests that biomass production may be determined by the most productive species present in a community. For all important canopy characteristics of multi-species communities, we show that with increasing diversity, mixtures perform better than the best monoculture. This is a strong indication that part of the positive effect of diversity on biomass production is driven by complementary resource use.},

Here we show that habitat loss appeared to disrupt ecosystem functioning by affecting extinction order, species richness and abundance. We studied pollination by bees in a mosaic of agricultural and natural habitats in California and dung burial by dung beetles on recently created islands in Venezuela. We found that large-bodied bee and beetle species tended to be both most extinction-prone and most functionally efficient, contributing to rapid functional loss. Simulations confirmed that extinction order led to greater disruption of function than predicted by random species loss. Total abundance declined with richness and also appeared to contribute to loss of function. We demonstrate conceptually and empirically how the non-random response of communities to disturbance can have unexpectedly large functional consequences.},

Methods Plant and soil samples were harvested from four sampling sites located in the low (Finnish) and high (Norwegian) Arctic.

The phenotypic (functional and antibiotic resistance) profiles of the soil bacterial communities were determined with BIOLOG Gen III plates. Results and conclusions Location and soil type, as well as plant species were shown to significantly influence the bacterial community structures. This was evident from the clustering of the communities per sampling location and per plant species in ordination plots. Geographical location as well as, plants also influenced the functional profiles of the soil bacterial communities.

abstract = {A major frontier in global change research is predicting how multiple agents of global change will alter plant productivity, a critical component of the carbon cycle. Recent research has shown that plant responses to climate change are phylogenetically conserved such that species within some lineages are more productive than those within other lineages in changing environments. However, it remains unclear how phylogenetic patterns in plant responses to changing abiotic conditions may be altered by another agent of global change, the introduction of non-native species. Using a system of 28 native Tasmanian Eucalyptus species belonging to two subgenera, Symphyomyrtus and Eucalyptus, we hypothesized that productivity responses to abiotic agents of global change (elevated CO2 and increased soil N) are unique to lineages, but that novel interactions with a non-native species mediate these responses. We tested this hypothesis by examining productivity of 1) native species monocultures and 2) mixtures of native species with an introduced hardwood plantation species, Eucalyptus nitens, to experimentally manipulated soil N and atmospheric CO2. Consistent with past research, we found that N limits productivity overall, especially in elevated CO2 conditions. However, monocultures of species within the Symphyomyrtus subgenus showed the strongest response to N (gained 127{\%} more total biomass) in elevated CO2 conditions, whereas those within the Eucalyptus subgenus did not respond to N. Root:shoot ratio (an indicator of resource use) was on average greater in species pairs containing Symphyomyrtus species, suggesting that functional traits important for resource uptake are phylogenetically conserved and explaining the phylogenetic pattern in plant response to changing environmental conditions. Yet, native species mixtures with E. nitens exhibited responses to CO2 and N that differed from those of monocultures, supporting our hypothesis and highlighting that both plant evolutionary history and introduced species will shape community productivity in a changing world.},

abstract = {Aims Post-dispersal seed predation is an important ecosystem process because it can influence the seed's fate after the initial dispersal from the mother plant and subsequently transform communities. Even at small scales, post-dispersal seed predation can vary greatly depending on seed identity, granivorous taxa or microhabitat structure. However, little is known about the role of plant species richness and functional group richness in post-dispersal seed predation. The overall aim of this study was to test whether increasing plant species richness or plant functional group richness affects the rate and variability of post-dispersal seed predation. We additionally investigated the influence of vegetation structure and seed species identity on the rate and variability of post-dispersal seed predation and whether the influence of different granivorous taxa changed with increasing plant species richness. Methods We conducted seed removal experiments along a long-term experimental plant diversity gradient, comprising plots with monocultures to 60 species mixtures of common grassland species in Jena, Germany, in August 2011. We studied seeds of Onobrychis viciifolia, Pastinaca sativa and Trifolium pratense in exclusion experiments (seed cafeterias), an experimental setup that allowed access either for arthropods or slugs or for all granivorous taxa. Traditionally, seeds removed from seed cafeterias were classified as consumed but we used traceable fluorescent-coloured seeds to obtain more accurate predation rates by subtracting recovered seeds from overall removed seeds. The effect of multiple vegetation variables on mean and variability of seed predation rates was analysed using generalized mixed-effect models and linear regressions, respectively. Important Findings Rates of recovered seeds were low but contributed to significant differences between seed predation rates and removal rates of seeds in some treatments. Seed predation rates were not directly correlated with increasing plant species richness or plant functional group richness but were influenced byseed species identity and granivorous taxa. Vegetation variables such as vegetation height and cover were significantly associated with seed predation rates. Depending on the seed species and/or the granivorous taxa, different vegetation variables correlated with seed predation rates. Our results indicate that effects of plant functional group richness and multiple vegetation variables on the magnitude of post-dispersal seed predation varied with seed identity and seed predator taxa. A direct effect of plant species and plant functional group richness could be shown on the variability of post-dispersal seed predation for some seed species and their respective predators. Thus, the changes in magnitude of post-dispersal seed predation with increasing plant species richness could potentially impact the fitness of some plant species and thereby influence plant community structure.},

abstract = {Improved agricultural practices are encouraged to reduce nitrate leaching and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the effects of these practices are often studied at annual or rotation scale without considering their long-term impacts. We have evaluated the effects of catch crops (CC), no-till (NT) and reduced nitrogen fertilization (N-) on nitrogen fate in soil-plant system during 13-17 years in three experiments in Northern France. CC were present in all sites whereas tillage treatment and N fertilization rate were tested separately at one site. Crop biomass, N uptake and N leaching were monitored during the whole period. The N balance, i.e. the difference between N inputs and crop exportations, was only affected by fertilization rate whereas leached N varied with all techniques. CC was the most efficient technique to decrease N leaching (from 36 to 62{\%}) and remained efficient on the long term. NT and N- had a positive but smaller impact. N storage in soil organic matter was markedly increased by CC (by 10-24 kg ha-1yr-1), decreased by N- (-7.3 kg ha-1yr-1) and not significantly affected by NT. The differences in gaseous N losses (denitrification + volatilization) between treatments were assessed by nitrogen mass balance. CC establishment had no significant effect on N gaseous emissions while NT increased them by 3.6 ± 0.9 kg N ha-1yr-1and N- reduced them by 13.6 ± 4.6 kg N ha-1yr-1. Catch crops appear as a win/win technique with respect to nitrate leaching and C and N sequestration in soil. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have examined relationships between primary production and biodiversity at higher trophic levels. However, altered production in plant communities is often tightly linked with concomitant shifts in diversity and composition, and most studies have not disentangled the direct effects of production on consumers. Furthermore, when studies do examine the effects of plant production on animals in terrestrial systems, they are primarily confined to a subset of taxonomic or functional groups instead of investigating the responses of the entire community. Using natural monocultures of the salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, we were able to examine the impacts of increased plant production, independent of changes in plant composition and/or diversity, on the trophic structure, composition, and diversity of the entire arthropod community. If arthropod species richness increased with greater plant production, we predicted that it would be driven by: (1) an increase in the number of rare species, and/or (2) an increase in arthropod abundance. Our results largely supported our predictions: species richness of herbivores, detritivores, predators, and parasitoids increased monotonically with increasing levels of plant production, and the diversity of rare species also increased with plant production. However, rare species that accounted for this difference were predators, parasitoids, and detritivores, not herbivores. Herbivore species richness could be simply explained by the relationship between abundance and diversity. Using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), we also found significant changes in arthropod species composition with increasing levels of production. Our findings have important implications in the intertidal salt marsh, where human activities have increased nitrogen runoff into the marsh, and demonstrate that such nitrogen inputs cascade to affect community structure, diversity, and abundance in higher trophic levels.},

abstract = {Grassland biomass has been identified as a potential energy source. The combustion of mature and fibrous biomass, as occurs in extensive grasslands managed with low cutting frequencies, is one possible conver- sion technique. This study tested the relationship between plant diversity and biomass constituents rele- vant for combustion, as they determine energy con- tent, energy yield and emission and corrosion risks. The biomass from a biodiversity experiment, with a species richness (SR) gradient of 1–60 species from Central European mesophilic grasslands divided into four functional groups (grasses, legumes, small and tall herbs), was harvested twice a year (in 2008 and 2009). The higher heating value (HHV) was estimated from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen contents to give insight into the energy potential of the species mix- tures. The potential risk of emission and corrosion was assessed by analysing ash content, potassium, calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, sulphur and chloride content. HHV was independent of SR, and the overall mean was 18{\textperiodcentered}13 MJ kg?1 DM. Biomass and gross energy (GE) yield were positively affected by SR. The pres- ence of legumes in a mixture resulted in increased HHV, biomass yield and GE, irrespective of the level of SR. Annual GE varied between 59 (average of monocultures) and 152 GJ ha?1 year?1 (mixture of sixty species). The concentration of ash-forming ele- ments was generally high, suggesting a pre-treatment of the biomass prior to combustion.

abstract = {We measured aboveground plant biomass and soil inorganic nitrogen pools in a biodiversity experiment in northern Sweden, with plant species richness ranging from 1 to 12 species. In general, biomass increased and nitrate pools decreased with increasing species richness. Transgressive overyielding of mixed plant communities compared to the most productive of the corresponding monocultures occurred in communities with and without legumes. N-2-fixing legumes had a fertilizing function, while non-legumes had a N retaining function. Plant communities with only legumes had a positive correlation between biomass and soil nitrate content, whereas in plant communities without legumes they were negatively correlated. Both nitrate and ammonium soil pools in mixed non-legume communities were approximately equal to the lowest observed in the corresponding monocultures. In mixed legume/non-legume communities, no correlation was found for soil nitrate with either biomass or legume biomass as percentage of total biomass. The idea of complementarity among species in nitrogen acquisition was supported in both pure non-legume and mixed non-legume/legume communities. In the latter, however, facilitation through increased nitrogen availability and retention, was probably dominating. Our results suggest that diversity effects on biomass and soil N pools through resource use complementarity depend on the functional traits of species, especially N-2 fixation or high productivity.},

abstract = {Trait-based approaches, which focus on the functional characteristics of organisms rather than their taxonomic identity, offer a means to explain how plant communities and ecosystem functions respond to environmental change. Here I review recent developments in the use of plant trait-based approaches for interrogating the functioning of soils and their response to global change. Plant traits impact soil functioning via multiple routes with feedback consequences for biogeochemical cycles and plant community dynamics. They also display a high degree of plasticity in response to global change; as such, there is much potential for global change-induced shifts in trait spectra, both aboveground and belowground, to impact soil functions with feedbacks to biogeochemical cycling across multiple scales. Recent research reveals that root traits play a particularly important role in influencing the soil environment, with strong impacts on a host of physical, chemical and biological soil properties. Although a fast-moving topic, many challenges regarding the use of trait-based approaches to interrogate soil functioning remain. I identify three. First, there is a need for improved understanding of genotypic- and species-level variation in plant traits, especially of root traits that have the strongest potential to influence soil function. Second, there is a need to incorporate new understanding of links between plant traits and soil processes into terrestrial biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models, in order to enhance their predictive power. Finally, there is a need to harness new understanding of plant traits and their impact on soil functions in sustainable food production systems, in particular to enhance resource acquisition by crop plants. This last point is especially important given the extent that soils are degraded worldwide, and the need to develop sustainable ways of managing soil to prevent further degradation whilst also increasing the production of food. INTRODUCTION},
annote = {- Evidence of importance of functional traits as drivers of belowground properties
(1) resource economic spectrum
(2) ecosytem properties depend more on traits than species per se

- Recent focus: using leaf traits to explain variation in soil microbial communities
(1) conservative plants promote fungi
(2) fast-growers promote bacteria
(3) mostly relevant to temperate grasslands
(4) litter chemistry and root traits are prob more important in tropics??
(5) another case for tropics: spatial mismatch

- Role of roots
(1) many functions - anchorage, resource uptake
(2) interspecific root trait variation is high
(3) belowground biomass {\textgreater} aboveground
(4) root traits explain variation in N cycling
(5) carbon - RLD, depth, lifespan, respiration, exudation
(6) root exudates - can increase or decrease N availabiliy
(7) mycoorhizal traits - influence N cycling, AM or ECM fungi in trees 
(8) root traits - modify soil environment - compressing soil particles, soil stability
(9) grasses had exploitative strategies, higher SRL, higher soil stability (species identity is importat

PSF
(1) traits influence PSF - spp modify soil - how they respond to changes (akin to effect/response traits)
(2) spp grew better in nutrient-rich soil conditions conditioned by exploitative community
(3) exploitative spp suffered most from negative feedback from soil boita
(4) conservative spp benefited from soil biota
(5) PSF depends on mycoorhizal type: AM trees - negative PSF, EcM trees - positive feedback 

PLANT TRAITS, SOILS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
- 'response-effect' framework 
- rapid plasticity in roots in response to global change??
- high plasticity due to changes in soil nitrogen supply, water supply, CO2 concentrations
- NOTE: root traits involved in nutrient uptake from heterogeneous soil (SOIL TYPE IS IMPORTANT).
- but, some question root plasticity. Maybe meausre different traits (root hairs, mycoorhizal association)??},

abstract = {Understanding bat use of human-altered habitat is critical for developing effective conservation plans for this ecologically important taxon. Green roofs, building rooftops covered in growing medium and vegetation, are increasingly important conservation tools that make use of underutilized space to provide breeding and foraging grounds for urban wildlife. Green roofs are especially important in highly urbanized areas such as New York City (NYC), which has more rooftops (34{\%}) than green space (13{\%}). To date, no studies have examined the extent to which North American bats utilize urban green roofs. To investigate the role of green roofs in supporting urban bats, we monitored bat activity using ultrasonic recorders on four green and four conventional roofs located in highly developed areas of NYC, which were paired to control for location, height, and local variability in surrounding habitat and species diversity. We then identified bat vocalizations on these recordings to the species level. We documented the presence of five of nine possible bat species over both roof types: Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus, L. noctivagans, P. subflavus,and. E. fuscus. Of the bat calls that could be identified to the species level, 66{\%} were from L. borealis. Overall levels of bat activity were higher over green roofs than over conventional roofs. This study provides evidence that, in addition to well documented ecosystem benefits, urban green roofs contribute to urban habitat availability for several North American bat species.},

abstract = {1. Current views of anthropogenic environments emphasize the extreme novelty of urban and industrial ecosystems. Proponents of reconciliation ecology argue thatwe need to use such habitats to conserve biodiversity, given the inadequacy of natural reserve systems. 2. Some of the harshest anthropogenic ecosystems may be able to support indigenous biodiversity due to their structural or functional resemblance to natural ecosystems, habitats, or microsites that may be present in the region but not part of the historic ecosystem on a particular site. Here we review recent work that evaluates similarities between urban and industrial ecosystems and natural analogues, and explore the potential for these in reconciliation ecology. 3. We find that artificial habitats represent a gradient of ecological novelty whichmay be indepen- dent of the degree of human influence.While hard-surfaced habitats such as walls and quarries are the most investigated artificial analogues (of natural rock pavements and cliffs), there are many other examples spanning a range of habitats in both terrestrial and marine settings.Analogous eco- systems may be present in the region but limits to dispersal can prevent appropriate species from reaching urban or industrial sites, and small differences in abiotic conditions can sometimes prevent colonization by native biota in otherwise similar artificial habitats.We suggest that a search for hab- itat analogues represents an important principle to guide reconciliation ecology in urban and indus- trial lands. In constrast, analogous ecosystems may also support pest species that exploit the similarities between anthropogenic habitats and their ancestral habitats. 4. Synthesis and applications. Identifying analogous habitats and ecosystems could enhance biodi- versity conservation and ecosystem services in anthropogenic environments. Abiotic and biotic differences between artificial analogues and natural systems can be frequently overcome by ecologi- cal engineering to make the environment more suitable for native biodiversity, and⁄or assisted dispersal to allow suitable native organisms to reach appropriate sites within artificial ecosystems. Altering some habitats to become less analogous may help reduce impacts of pest species in urban and industrial areas. Key-words:},

The plants were grown at two sowing densities in monocultures and all possible species combinations. Our aim was to separate the selection effect from other diversity effects. This distinction is based on the notion that true overyielding is not a consequence of the selection effect. We suggest a hierarchical procedure, which is based on a repeated division of samples into the pots with the most productive species present and missing. Overyielding can be then demonstrated by a positive dependence of productivity on species richness in the subsets with the most productive species present. Although we found a strong dependence of biomass on species richness in the entire data set, the hierarchical method revealed no evidence of overyielding.

abstract = {We tested predictions of the relative changes in plant leaf traits in response to land uses in Australian eucalypt grassy ecosystems. Predictions were determined from responses observed in European landscapes in relation to disturbances associated with agricultural land uses. We measured specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) across five land uses: reference sites (closest to pre-European state), native pastures (unfertilized), fertilized pastures, sown pastures (cultivated and fertilized) and enriched grassland (previously fertilized, no longer grazed). Leaves were expected to have higher SLA and lower LMDC at sites with increasing fertility and/or disturbance. The predictions were confirmed, with SLA increasing progressively in land uses associated with (1) grazing; (2) grazing and fertilization; (3) grazing, fertilization and cultivation. Values for LDMC were closely (but inversely) correlated with those of SLA. For both traits, there were relationships with available soil phosphorus but not with soil total nitrogen. The positive correlation of SLA with phosphorus was not evident above 30 mg kg-1, the recommended level of phosphorus for improved pastures. Results confirm patterns of leaf-trait response to disturbance that reflect fundamental constraints to plant survival in habitats with different levels of resources and disturbances. A conservative strategy for low productivity undisturbed habitats is associated with low SLA and high dry matter content in contrast to fertile disturbed habitats which select for high SLA and low dry matter content. The changes in leaf traits across land uses resulted from species substitution rather than variation within species across sites, and most notably the replacement of native by annual exotic species as land use intensifies. Recommended fertilization rates for pasture production convert the ground layer to plants with soft, digestible leaves, that are responsive to fertilizer and desirable for livestock production. However, fertilization also drastically reduces the diversity of native plants and annual plants tend to dominate. The trade-off associated with high production includes increased vulnerability to soil erosion, due to reduced plant cover and low persistence of cover. If alternative ecosystem values such as erosion control, water quality, salinity control and biodiversity persistence are required, incentives may be needed to offset the loss of production that can be gained from fertilizer application.

abstract = {The Des Plaines River Wetlands Demonstration Project includes a series of man-made marshes constructed on degraded habitat (abandoned agricultural land, gravel quarrying pits, etc.) within the floodplain of the Des Plaines River in northeastern Illinois, USA. Avian use of the site was measured before wetland construction in 1985 and after construction from spring 1990 to summer 1991. Pre-construction censusing indicated that no endangered or threatened species nested within the project site, and that use of the site by migratory waterfowl was minimal. Post-construction censuses revealed that wetland construction resulted in the arrival of two state endangered species, Least Bittern and Yellow-headed Blackbird, which nested on site, and in three state endangered species, Pied-billed Grebe, Great Egret, and Black-crowned Night-Heron, which visited the site during the breeding season. Similarly, post-construction censusing indicated that the number of individuals and species of waterfowl using the site increased about 4000{\%} and 400{\%}, respectively. These results demonstrate that the Des Plaines River Wetlands Demonstration Project has improved habitat quality for nesting and migrating birds. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {To better understand water uptake patterns in root systems of woody perennial crops, we detailed the developmental anatomy and hydraulic physiology along the length of grapevine (Vitis berlandieri × Vitis rupestris) fine roots from the tip to secondary growth zones. Our characterization included the localization of suberized structures and aquaporin gene expression and the determination of hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) and aquaporin protein activity (via chemical inhibition) in different root zones under both osmotic and hydrostatic pressure gradients. Tissue-specific messenger RNA levels of the plasma membrane aquaporin isogenes (VvPIPs) were quantified using laser-capture microdissection and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Our results highlight dramatic changes in structure and function along the length of grapevine fine roots. Although the root tip lacked suberization altogether, a suberized exodermis and endodermis developed in the maturation zone, which gave way to the secondary growth zone containing a multilayer suberized periderm. Longitudinally, VvPIP isogenes exhibited strong peaks of expression in the root tip that decreased precipitously along the root length in a pattern similar to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots. In the radial orientation, expression was always greatest in interior tissues (i.e. stele, endodermis, and/or vascular tissues) for all root zones. High Lpr and aquaporin protein activity were associated with peak VvPIP expression levels in the root tip. This suggests that aquaporins play a limited role in controlling water uptake in secondary growth zones, which contradicts existing theoretical predictions. Despite having significantly lower Lpr, woody roots can constitute the vast majority of the root system surface area in mature vines and thus provide for significant water uptake potential.},

abstract = {Because the frequency of heterospecific interactions inevitably increases with species richness in a community, biodiversity effects must be expressed by such interactions. However, little is understood how heterospecific interactions affect ecosystem productivity because rarely are biodiversity ecosystem functioning experiments spatially explicitly manipulated. To test the effect of heterospecific interactions on productivity, direct evidence of heterospecific neighborhood interaction is needed. In this study we conducted experiments with a detailed spatial design to investigate whether and how heterospecific neighborhood interactions promote primary productivity in a grassland community. The results showed that increasing the heterospecific: conspecific contact ratio significantly increased productivity. We found there was a significant difference in the variation in plant height between monoculture and mixture communities, suggesting that height-asymmetric competition for light plays a central role in promoting productivity. Heterospecific interactions make tall plants grow taller and short plants become smaller in mixtures compared to monocultures, thereby increasing the efficiency of light interception and utilization. Overyielding in the mixture communities arises from the fact that the loss in the growth of short plants is compensated by the increased growth of tall plants. The positive correlation between species richness and primary production was strengthened by increasing the frequency of heterospecific interactions. We conclude that species richness significantly promotes primary ecosystem production through heterospecific neighborhood interactions.},

abstract = {Mixed forests are thought to provide a wide range of ecosystem services for human well-being and their effectiveness, compared to monocultures, is broadly recognized in the literature. Mixed forests may increase the multifunctionality, providing a wide range of ecosystem services such as hazard protection, carbon sequestration, nature conservation and landscape values. Before undertaking a process of conversion of monocultures into mixed forests it is important to learn about perceptions of local stakeholders for mixed forests in comparison to monocultures, in order to understand their needs and identify possible sources of conflicts. In the present work, we investigate the personal perceptions about the effectiveness of mixed forests when compared to monocultures, in terms of provisioning of ecosystem services, with the aid of an ordered logit model. In addition, we highlight the fact that belonging to a particular category of organized stakeholders contribute to perceive mixed forests positively, compared to non-organized local dwellers. Results show that people acknowledging the importance of some non-productive forest ecosystem services are more likely to prefer mixed forests. Moreover, personal attitudes towards ecosystem services seem to be much more related to the degree of preference for mixed forests than other socio-economic variables, such as gender and education. Finally, another evidence of this contribution is that belonging to a precisely defined group of stakeholders considerably increases the probability to prefer mixed forests, compared to ordinary citizens.},

However, tree dynamics may be masked by large-scale heterogeneous site conditions, e.g. when the restricting size of regeneration sites superimposes emergent patterns. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n2. Here we ask how environmental heterogeneity may influence the spatial dynamics of plant communities. We compared the spatial patterns and demographics of western hemlock in a homogeneous and a heterogeneous site of old-growth Douglas-fir forests on Vancouver Island using recent techniques of point pattern analysis. We used homogeneous and inhomogeneous K- and pair-correlation functions, and case-control studies to quantify the change in spatial distribution for different size classes of western hemlock. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n3. Our comparative analyses show that biological processes interacted with spatial heterogeneity, leading to qualitatively different population dynamics at the two sites. Population structure, survival and size structure of western hemlock were different in the heterogeneous stand in such a way that, compared to the homogeneous stand, seedlings were more clustered, seedling densities higher, seedling mortality lower, adult growth faster and adult mortality higher. Under homogeneous site conditions, seedling survival was mainly abiotically determined by random arrival in small gaps with limiting light. At the heterogeneous site, seedling densities and initial survival were much higher, leading to strong density-dependent mortality and selection for faster growing individuals in larger size classes. We hypothesise that the dynamics of the heterogeneous stand were faster due to asymmetric competition with disproportionate benefit to taller plants. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n4. Synthesis. Our study supports the hypothesis that successional dynamics are intensified in heterogeneous forest stands with strong spatial structures and outlines the importance of spatial heterogeneity as a determinant of plant population dynamics and pattern formation.},

We explore the effects of crop species richness on the diversity of pest insects and their natural enemies. Using data from a four-year experiment with five levels of crop species richness, we found that crop species richness significantly affected the pest species richness, but there were no significant effects on richness of the pests' natural enemies. In contrast, the species richness of pest insects significantly affected their natural enemies. These findings suggest a cascade effect where trophic interactions are strong between adjacent trophic levels, while the interactions between connected but nonadjacent trophic levels are weakened by the intermediate trophic level. High crop species richness resulted in a more stable arthropod community compared with communities in monoculture crops. Our results highlight the complicated cross-trophic interactions and the crucial role of crop diversity in the food webs of agro-ecosystems.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

We conducted a factorial experiment to investigate the effects of three plant species combinations (1, 2 and 4 species) on soil microbial and soil enzyme properties under three Pb concentrations (0, 300 and 600 mg kg-1soil). Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), BIOLOG profiles of soil microbes and soil enzyme activities were measured. Under monoculture, elevated Pb did not reduce soil MBC, had no effects on activities of urease, acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase, but stimulated the activity of alkaline phosphatase. Compared to monoculture, plant species coexistence did not significantly affect soil microbial biomass C but increased microbial functional group diversity index and urease activity under different Pb concentrations. In addition, microbial community structure diverged among plant coexistence treatments under each Pb concentration. These results suggested that coexistence of plant species might alleviate the effects of metal lead on soil microbes and reducing metal lead effect on urease activity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Plant species effects on microbial communities are attributed to changes in microbial community composition and biomass, and may depend on plant species specific differences in the quality of resources (carbon) inputs. We examined the idea that plant-soil feedbacks can be explained by a chance effect, which is the probability of a highly productive or keystone plant species is present in the community and will influence the functions more than the number of species per se. A13C pulse labelling technique was applied to three plant species and a species mixture in a greenhouse experiment to examine the carbon flow from plants to soil microbial communities. The13C label was given as CO2to shoots of a legume (Lotus corniculatus), a forb (Plantago lanceolata), a grass (Holcus lanatus) and a mixture of the three species. Microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) was analysed in order to determine the biomass and composition of the soil microbial community. The incorporation of the stable isotope into soil microorganisms was determined through GC-IRMS analyses of the microbial PLFAs. Plant species identity did not influence the microbial biomass when determined as total carbon of microbial phospholipid fatty acids. However, the labelled carbon showed that the grass monoculture (H. lanatus) and the plant mixture allocated more13C into bacteria and actinomycete biomass than the other plant species. H. lanatus monocultures had also the highest amounts of13C allocated to AM-fungi and saprophytic fungi. The carbon allocation from plants to soil microorganisms in a plant species mixture can thus be explained by the presence of a highly productive species that influence soil functions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although landscape heterogeneity can rescue bee communities from collapsing, these insects seem sensitive to reduced functional connectivity, hindering pollen transfer among plants. Our objective was to verify which of these two factors, landscape heterogeneity or functional connectivity, can better explain variations of bee abundance and richness in a fragmented Atlantic Forest region. We sampled flower-visiting bees in 12 landscapes with varying heterogeneity and functional connectivity measured using a Functional Ecological Corridors framework. Both richness and abundance were affected by landscape factors, reaching its highest levels at intermediate levels of functional connectivity in highly heterogeneous landscapes, indicating the existence of strong regime shifts in the system. In low-forested landscapes, conservation actions for pollinating bees should focus on implementing diversified environments with high quality which are interspersed among each other and with native vegetation.},

In this study, we tested the biodiversity–ecosystem function hypothesis using commercially available green roof trays as replicated plots with varying levels of plant species richness (0, 1, 3, or 6 common green roof species per plot, using plants with different functional characteristics). We estimated accumulated plant biomass near the peak of the first full growing season (July 2013) and measured runoff volume after nearly every rain event from September 2012 to September 2013 (33 events) and runoff fluxes of inorganic nutrients ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate from a subset of 10 events. We found that (1) total plant biomass increased with increasing species richness, (2) green roof plots were effective at reducing storm runoff, with vegetation increasing water retention more than soil-like substrate alone, but there was no significant effect of plant species identity or richness on runoff volume, (3) green roof substrate was a significant source of phosphate, regardless of presence/absence of plants, and (4) dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = nitrate + ammonium) runoff fluxes were different among plant species and decreased significantly with increasing plant species richness. The variation in N retention was positively related to variation in plant biomass. Notably, the increased biomass and N retention with species richness in this engineered ecosystem are similar to patterns observed in published studies from grasslands and other well-studied ecosystems. We suggest that more diverse plantings on vegetated roofs may enhance the retention capacity for reactive nitrogen. This is of importance for the sustained health of vegetated roof ecosystems, which over time often experience nitrogen limitation, and is also relevant for water quality in receiving waters downstream of green roofs.},

Despite centuries of interest, the contributions of different evolutionary lineages to modern-day functional diversity remain poorly quantified. 2. Expanding data bases of plant traits plus rapidly improving phylogenies enable for the first time a data-driven global picture of plant functional diversity across the major clades of higher plants. We mapped five key traits relevant to metabolism, resource competition and reproductive strategy onto a phylogeny across 48324 vascular plant species world-wide, along with climate and biogeo- graphic data. Using a novel metric, we test whether major plant lineages are functionally distinctive. We then highlight the trait–lineage combinations that are most functionally distinctive within the present-day spread of ecological strategies. 3. For some trait–clade combinations, knowing the clade of a species conveys little information to neo- and palaeo-ecologists. In other trait–clade combinations, the clade identity can be highly reveal- ing, especially informative clade–trait combinations include Proteaceae, which is highly distinctive, representing the global slow extreme of the leaf economic spectrum. Magnoliidae and Rosidae con- tribute large leaf sizes and seed masses and have distinctively warm, wet climatic distributions. 4. Synthesis.

abstract = {One robust result from many small-scale experiments has been that plant community productivity often increases with increasing plant diversity. Most frequently, resource-based or competitive interactions are thought to drive this positive diversity-productivity relationship. Here, we ask whether suppression of plant productivity by soil fungal pathogens might also drive a positive diversity-productivity relationship. We created plant assemblages that varied in diversity and crossed this with a ± soil fungicide treatment. In control (non-fungicide treated) assemblages there was a strong positive relationship between plant diversity and above-ground plant biomass. However, in fungicide-treated assemblages this relationship disappeared. This occurred because fungicide increased plant production by an average of 141{\%} at the lower ends of diversity but boosted production by an average of only 33{\%} at the higher ends of diversity, essentially flattening the diversity-productivity curve. These results suggest that soil pathogens might be a heretofore unappreciated driver of diversity-productivity relationships.},

abstract = {The establishment pattern of monocultures of 61 species common to Central European semi-natural grasslands was analysed in a field experiment. The objectives were to identify key traits for successful establishment, defined in terms of above-ground biomass production, and to characterize the degree of niche overlap with respect to the use of above-ground resources, such as light and space. Four months after sowing, 15 species reached an above-ground biomass of more than 400 g m(-2). Highly productive monocultures adopted extremely different strategies of space filling in terms of canopy height, biomass density and centre of gravity of vertical biomass distribution. Regression tree analysis identified (1) the number of seedlings and (2) a trade-off between the development of a large number of small-sized shoots of species with intensive clonal growth in contrast to the establishment of fewer large-sized shoots as the two most important traits for successful establishment. Further variables associated with high above-ground biomass production by individual species were traits known to be relevant to the relative growth rate of herbaceous species, such as specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen or allocation between shoots and roots. The principle finding of this study is that the success of the 15 most productive species was not based on a single pathway but on a variable combination of traits. There are clearly many possible combinations of morphological and physiological features that will result in a species becoming productive, and these combinations differ among species in a local species pool.},

abstract = {Community persistence, or the ability of a community to maintain species composition and diversity through time, is a component of stability that is important to restoration. We ran a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment for three years, and then stopped weeding it for 5-6 years, which allowed us to test whether increased plant species diversity and dissimilarity in height would lead to increased community persistence in the face of high invasion pressure by non-native species. Our approach was unique in that the experiment varied richness (one or four species) and evenness (three levels plus monocultures of the dominant species) using two separate dissimilarity types (having all tall species or having tall and short species combined) in six spatiotemporal blocks. Persistence was quantified as to how well positive productivity-diversity relationships, proportion of planted native species, and species richness remained unchanged over time. Thus, high persistence values indicate low levels of invasion and local extinction. We found that the positive relationship between diversity measures and productivity persisted after cessation of weeding. The proportion of planted species was 32{\%} higher in mixture than in monoculture plots, indicating that monocultures were more heavily invaded by non-native species. Reduced evenness did not affect persistence measures in plots with dissimilar heights, but measures declined linearly with decreased evenness in plots with all tall species. Our results suggest that (1) persistence-diversity relationships are likely to vary with the traits of species becoming rare and going extinct, and (2) it is important to restore higher species diversity in restoration projects to favor the long-term persistence of planted species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gesellschaft fU{\{}double grave{\}}r U{\{}double grave{\}}kologie.},

abstract = {A green roof is a vegetated roof or deck designed to provide urban greening for buildings, people, or the environment. Made popular across Europe over the past few decades, green roofs are now becoming more familiar to North Americans as some cities have built green roof pilot projects and adopted incentives for using green roofs or even require their use. Green roof standards and guidelines are also emerging to be used for governance and project specification. Although much is known about the application of green roofs across Europe, much less is known about their application across North America's diverse ecological regions. When considering the many decisions required in applying green roof technology to a specific place, there are few choices more critical to their success than the selection of appropriate vegetation. We conducted a review of green roof research to investigate what is known about the application of plants on green roofs across North America and their ecological implications. Results indicate that investigation sites across ecoregions begin to reveal differences in plant survival. Although ecological investigations are limited, their results show improved plant performance and ecological services with diverse green roofs. We conclude that as green roofs continue to become regulated and adopted in policy, further development of standards and guidelines is needed. To date, there is no common ground for reporting of green roof research, and we make recommendations for facilitating such efforts for improved research, policy development and their management across North America's diverse ecological regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Algorithms for estimating root length by image analysis should lead to results that have no systematic error (bias), be insensitive to preferential root orientation, valid across a wide range of sample sizes and adjust for overlap between roots in samples, to reduce the effort needed in spreading out root systems. We propose a new algorithm that forms a compromise between small bias and robustness (insensitivity to variation in sample size and preferential root orientation), and provide a simple way of dealing with root overlap. Image analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. The digital image of the root was processed to get the thinned image (skeleton). The numbers of orthogonally and diagonally connected pairs of pixels (No andNd, respectively) in the skeletonwere counted separately and used for length (L) calculation.A new length calculation equation was introduced so that the effect of orientation on length calculation was minimized; L =[Nd2 + (Nd + No/2)2]1/2 + No/2. The maximum error due to orientation of a single line was evaluated for an ideal line, and the analysis revealed that the new equation was less affected by orientation than previous equations. Copper wire and rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots containing both primary and fine secondary root were measured manually andwith image analysis. The two methods showed good agreementwithin 1.5{\%}. The proposed image analysis method yielded length estimates with CV from 0.23 to 0.88{\%}, which was lower than the CVs of the line-intersect method. Moreover, the lengths of overlapping samples were calculated correctly because the image analysis method distinguished an overlapping pixel from a thinned image, while the calculation with the line-intersect method showed underestimation because overlaps were not considered in that method.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The functioning of ecosystems results from the interplay between living organisms and their surroundings. Therefore, our ability to predict ecosystem functioning depends on our understanding of interactions between dynamic biotic and abiotic variables. Biodiversity can be influenced by the changes in the environment and can also influence ecosystem functioning, but our understanding of how environmental changes influence biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships remains limited. In coastal marine systems, water flow is a crucial determinant of resource delivery for sessile suspension-feeding animals and can potentially influence secondary production and the rate at which suspended materials are removed from water, determining water clarity, light penetration, and other key abiotic variables. We experimentally investigated how the presence and absence of water flow influenced phytoplankton consumption by suspension-feeder communities of varying species richness and composition. Consumer species richness enhanced filtration to the same degree in both flow conditions, despite generally decreased filtration in flow and considerable variation in the response to flow by consumers in monoculture. Species pairs filtered more than expected from monoculture performance, and species traits helped explain variance in these trends. However, there was no evidence of prey size selectivity by any consumer species, ruling this out as a mechanism underlying diversity effects. Our finding that the shape of the relationship between biodiversity and water filtration was identical in both flow conditions suggests that complementarity in this system is robust to at least one type of environmental variation.},

At the Pyrenean treeline, the dwarf shrub Vaccinium myrtillus grows in pure stands or in mixed stands with Vaccinium uliginosum or Rhododendron ferrugineum. They form sparse shrub patches that colonize subalpine grasslands, having dramatic impacts on their structure and functioning. We investigated the role of the two co-occurring shrubs as possible modulators of the structure and performance of V. myrtillus in the Central Pyrenees. We analysed biomass, growth, functional parameters, age distribution, N and C concentrations and isotope compositions ($\delta$15N and $\delta$ 13C) of V. myrtillus ramets in pure stands, and stands mixed with V. uliginosum or R. ferrugineum. Volume, above-ground biomass and age of the ramets did not differ between stand types. We found lower $\delta$13C values, indicative of lower water-use efficiency (WUE), in leaves and shoots of V. myrtillus in stands with R. ferrugineum than in pure stands. The N content and $\delta$15N of V. myrtillus leaves and shoots in pure stands were higher than in mixed stands, pointing to a competition for N in mixed stands. Our results indicate that V. myrtillus competes for nutrients with its neighbours, but neither this competition nor the lower WUE affect its above-ground performance. Therefore, the interaction with co-occurring shrubs does not have a major effect on V. myrtillus structure and functioning at treeline and, consequently, should not be considered as a key driver on the dynamics of this species in the encroachment of subalpine grasslands.},

Methods To examine temporal development and additivity of feedback, two pairs of native and non-native congeneric grasses were grown alone or in mixtures to create six soil conditioning treatments. We measured plant growth and feedback on the soils over 19 months and addressed whether plant biomass was additive or non-additive between soils treated by mixtures and their constituent monocultures. Results For native grasses, plant-soil feedback either became progressively more negative through time or switched from neutral to negative. Feedback to non-native grasses was variably neutral to positive. Final biomass of the grasses growing on soils conditioned by mixtures was generally an additive function of growth on soils conditioned by the component monocultures, except native grasses growing in soils conditioned by their own congener mixtures, which were non-additive. Conclusions Temporal variation and non-additivity in feedback suggest that extrapolation to communities may be complex. More work is needed to assess the generality of temporal and scaling effects.},

abstract = {Although much is known about drivers of productivity in Douglas-fir and red alder stands, less is known about how productivity may relate to stand transpiration and water use efficiency. We took advantage of a 15-year-old experiment involving Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and red alder (Alnus rubra) in the western Cascade Range of western Oregon to test the following hypotheses: (a) more productive stands transpire more water, (b) the relationship between productivity and transpiration differs between species, and (c) the relationship between productivity and transpiration differs between sites varying in soil moisture and fertility. Furthermore, the experimental design included alder, a facultative nitrogen-fixing species, which could also affect fertility. Fixed area plots (20×20m) were planted as monocultures of each species or in mixtures at a common density (1100treesha-1) in a randomized-block design. Transpiration of Douglas-fir and red alder was measured using heat dissipation sensors installed in eight trees per plot and scaled to the plot level based on sapwood basal area for each species. Although up to 53{\%} of the variability in tree transpiration was explained by basal area, irrespective of species or site conditions, the two stands with the highest biomass and sapwood basal area did not transpire the most. Instead of more productive stands transpiring more water, the greatest variability in both productivity and transpiration was determined by site conditions and to a lesser degree, species composition. For example, 70{\%} of the variation in tree biomass increment (TBI) was determined by leaf area index, which was much higher at the site with higher fertility and soil moisture (p{\textless}0.05). Despite marked phenological and physiological differences, Douglas-fir and red alder performed similarly. Only 19{\%} of annual water use of Douglas-fir occurred between October and March when alder was leafless. Also, there was no evidence of a fertilization effect of the nitrogen-fixing red alder on the Douglas-fir: the nitrogen concentration and N-isotopic ratio of Douglas-fir needles did not differ whether trees were grown in monoculture or in mixtures with red alder. We conclude that lower soil fertility and contrasting microclimate at one site relative to the other suppressed NPP while maintaining higher transpiration, thus reducing water use efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The role of biodiversity in mediating ecosystem processes has been the subject of focused theoretical and empirical attention since the mid-1990s. Theory predicts that the balance between species richness and identity effects will critically depend on the degree of environmental heterogeneity, which dictates the extent to which differences between species in patterns of resource use can be expressed. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to explicitly test this hypothesis. We manipulated the richness and identity of intertidal molluscan grazers, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of the substrate upon which they grazed. The magnitude of algal consumption was used as our focal ecosystem process. The grazer treatments consisted of three monocultures and a single polyculture including all three species; heterogeneity was represented as the proportion of topographically complex and flat substrate. Species identity had strong effects on homogeneous substrates, with the identity of the best-performing species dependent on the substrate. On the heterogeneous substrate, suitable conditions for all three species were represented, allowing the expression of spatial complementarity of resource use and the enhancement of total algal consumption. Our findings provide the first explicit experimental evidence that spatial heterogeneity of the physical environment can play a key role in mediating effects of species diversity.},

Most applications have been designed to treat municipal or domestic wastewater but at present, constructed wetlands are successfully applied to many types of wastewater. The early constructed wetlands applied to industrial wastewaters included those for wastewaters from petrochemical, abattoir, meat processing, dairy and pulp and paper industries. During the 1990s constructed wetlands were also used to treat effluents from textile and wine industries or water from recirculating fish and shrimp aquacultures. The most recent applications include those for brewery or tannery wastewaters as well as olive mills effluents. The survey revealed that both subsurface and surface flow constructed wetlands have been used for treatment of industrial wastewaters. Within subsurface flow constructed wetlands both horizontal and vertical flow systems have been designed. Also, the use of various hybrid constructed wetlands for industrial effluent treatment has been reported in the literature recently. The survey also revealed that industrial wastewaters are treated in constructed wetlands in all continents and this paper includes the information from 138 constructed wetlands in 33 countries worldwide.},

Although most bees nest in the ground, considerable effort has centered on installing 'bee hotels'-also known as nest boxes or trap nests-which artificially aggregate nest sites of above ground nesting bees. Campaigns to 'save the bees' often promote these devices despite the absence of data indicating they have a positive effect. From a survey of almost 600 bee hotels set up over a period of three years in Toronto, Canada, introduced bees nested at 32.9{\%} of sites and represented 24.6{\%} of more than 27,000 total bees and wasps recorded (47.1{\%} of all bees recorded). Native bees were parasitized more than introduced bees and females of introduced bee species provisioned nests with significantly more female larva each year. Native wasps were significantly more abundant than both native and introduced bees and occupied almost 3/4 of all bee hotels each year; further, introduced wasps were the only group to significantly increase in relative abundance year over year. More research is needed to elucidate the potential pitfalls and benefits of using bee hotels in the conservation and population dynamics of wild native bees.},

abstract = {Plants develop most organs post-embryonically, which allows the incorporation of environmental information into decisions concerning when and where to produce new organs. This developmental plasticity is evident in the plant root system, which in dicotyledonous plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana is mostly comprised of lateral and adventitious roots that develop along the length of the primary root. The rate of primary root growth and the location, spacing and growth rate of lateral roots are influenced by the availability of environmental cues such as water and nutrients, which can have dramatic effects on the final architecture of the root system. These environmental responses must intersect with the intrinsic developmental programme of the plant, which is responsible for the general formation and maintenance of the root system. The final root system architecture of any plant is then the product of both intrinsic and environmental response pathways. Carbohydrates and plant hormones such as auxin and cytokinins are required for both intrinsic root development and modulating root system architecture in response to different growth conditions, thus facilitating the optimisation of root growth in complex, heterogeneous environments. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Ecological engineering is defined as "the design of sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both." It involves the restoration of ecosystems that have been substantially disturbed by human activities such as environmental pollution or land disturbance; and the development of new sustainable ecosystems that have both human and ecological value. While there was some early discussion of ecological engineering in the 1960s, its development was spawned later by several factors, including loss of confidence in the view that all pollution problems can be solved through technological means and the realization that with technological means, pollutants are just being moved from one form to another. Conventional approaches require massive amounts of resources to solve these problems, and that in turn perpetuates carbon and nitrogen cycle problems, for example. The development of ecological engineering was given strong impetus in the last decade with a textbook, the journal Ecological Engineering and two professional ecological engineering societies. Five principles about ecological engineering are: (1) It is based on the self-designing capacity of ecosystems; (2) It can be the acid test of ecological theories; (3) It relies on system approaches; (4) It conserves non-renewable energy sources; and (5) It supports biological conservation. Ecology as a science is not routinely integrated into engineering curricula, even in environmental engineering programs, while shortcoming, ecologists, environmental scientists, and managers miss important training in their profession - problem solving. These two problems could be solved in the integrated field of ecological engineering. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of community coexistence and ecosystem functioning may help to counteract the current biodiversity loss and its potentially harmful consequences. In recent years, plant-soil feedback that can, for example, be caused by below-ground microorganisms has been suggested to play a role in maintaining plant coexistence and to be a potential driver of the positive relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Most of the studies addressing these topics have focused on the species level. However, in addition to interspecific interactions, intraspecific interactions might be important for the structure of natural communities. Here, we examine intraspecific coexistence and intraspecific diversity effects using 10 natural accessions of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. We assessed morphological intraspecific diversity by measuring several above- and below-ground traits. We performed a plant-soil feedback experiment that was based on these trait differences between the accessions in order to determine whether A. thaliana experiences feedback at intraspecific level as a result of trait differences. We also experimentally tested the diversity-productivity relationship at intraspecific level. We found strong differences in above- and below-ground traits between the A. thaliana accessions. Overall, plant-soil feedback occurred at intraspecific level. However, accessions differed in the direction and strength of this feedback: Some accessions grew better on their own soils, some on soils from other accessions. Furthermore, we found positive diversity effects within A. thaliana: Accession mixtures produced a higher total above-ground biomass than accession monocultures. Differences between accessions in their feedback response could not be explained by morphological traits. Therefore, we suggest that they might have been caused by accession-specific accumulated soil communities, by root exudates, or by accession-specific resource use based on genetic differences that are not expressed in morphological traits. Synthesis. Our results provide some of the first evidence for intraspecific plant-soil feedback and intraspecific overyielding. These findings may have wider implications for the maintenance of variation within species and the importance of this variation for ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight the need for an increased focus on intraspecific processes in plant diversity research to fully understand the mechanisms of coexistence and ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Most studies evaluating the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning are conducted at a single location, limiting our understanding of how diversity–function relationships may change when measured across different spatial scales. We conducted a species-removal experiment at three sites nested in each of three regions along the rocky intertidal coastline of the Gulf of Maine, USA, to evaluate the potential for scale-dependent effects of species loss on the biomass of intertidal seaweed assemblages. We randomly assigned 50 plots in the mid-intertidal zone at each site to one of five treatments (n = 10 plots each): an unmanipulated control, a polyculture plot that contained our three target seaweed species, and three monoculture plots. We manipulated diversity by removing all non-target species from monoculture and polyculture plots, then removing additional biomass from polyculture plots, proportionate to species' relative abundances, so that the average amount removed from monoculture and polyculture plots was equivalent at each site. At the largest spatial scale, all sites considered together, after accounting for region and site nested within region seaweed diversity had consistent, positive effects on seaweed cover. Diverse polyculture plots always had higher cover than was predicted by the average performance of the component seaweed species and usually had higher cover than even the best-performing component species. Diversity effects weakened and became less consistent at smaller spatial scales, so that at the scale of individual sites, diverse polycultures only performed better than the average of monocultures {\~{}}40{\%} of the time. Hence, our results indicate that weak and/or inconsistent biodiversity effects at the level of individual sites may scale up to stronger, more consistent effects at larger spatial scales. Quantitative summaries of biodiversity experiments conducted at the scale of individual sites do not capture this spatial aspect of biodiversity effects and may therefore underestimate the functional consequences of biodiversity loss.},

abstract = {Many studies have described the effects of urbanization on species richness. These studies indicate that urbanization can increase or decrease species richness, depending on several variables. Some of these variables include: taxonomic group, spatial scale of analysis, and intensity of urbanization. Recent reviews of birds (the most-studied group) indicate that species richness decreases with increasing urbanization in most cases but produces no change or even increases richness in some studies. Here I expand beyond the bird studies by reviewing 105 studies on the effects of urbanization on the species richness of non-avian species: mammals, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates and plants. For all groups, species richness tends to be reduced in areas with extreme urbanization (i.e., central urban core areas). However, the effects of moderate levels of urbanization (i.e., suburban areas) vary significantly among groups. Most of the plant studies (about 65{\%}) indicate increasing species richness with moderate urbanization whereas only a minority of invertebrate studies (about 30{\%}) and a very small minority of non-avian vertebrate studies (about 12{\%}) show increasing species richness. Possible explanations for these results are discussed, including the importance of nonnative species importation, spatial heterogeneity, intermediate disturbance and scale as major factors influencing species richness.},

abstract = {Complementary resource use is regarded as a mechanism that contributes to positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, we used a biodiversity experiment composed of nine potentially dominant species (grasses: Alopecurus pratensis, Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata, Phleum pratense, Poa trivialis; legumes: Trifolium pratense, T. repens; non-legume herbs: Anthriscus sylvestris, Geranium pratense) to test for differences among monocultures and mixtures and for effects of species richness and the presence of particular species on the use of aboveground space. The number of rooting shoots determined in a line transect increased from monocultures to mixtures. Particularly, the presence of A. elatius in mixtures caused a higher shoot density at the community level. The number of pin contacts per sampling point (cumulative cover) at the community level, analysed with the point intercept method, was higher in mixtures than monocultures, and higher in mixtures with than without A. elatius. The effect was attributable to increased densities across the strata of the vertical stand profile as well as to an increase in community height. The impact of species richness on the use of aboveground space differed considerably between individual species. A. elatius achieved increased densities across all strata of the stand profile, while D. glomerata reached higher densities with a more pronounced use of space in the upper strata with increasing species richness of mixtures. Cumulative cover of P. pratense and A. pratensis was not affected by species richness, while the remaining species decreased space use mostly in the upper strata with increasing species richness or in mixtures with the competitively superior A. elatius. Our study shows that potentially dominant species are limited in their ability for adaptive responses to canopy shading. Nevertheless, the differential responses to species richness of individual species with regard to vertical niche occupation resulted in positive diversity effects on aboveground space use at the community level. {\textcopyright} 2008 R{\"{u}}bel Foundation, ETH Z{\"{u}}rich.},

abstract = {* • We enumerated arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal spore communities for 3 yr as part of a long-term CO2 enrichment experiment at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, USA. Complete factorial combinations of two levels of CO2 and N, and 16 perennial plant species grown in monoculture and 16-species polyculture were arranged in a split-plot design. * • In 1998–2000, spore communities were quantified under monocultures of eight plant species. In 2000, measurements were expanded to include monocultures and polycultures of all of the plant species. * • Under plant monocultures, only Glomus clarum responded significantly to CO2 elevation out of 11 species present. This response was not detectable under plant polycultures. Glomus clarum was also significantly more abundant under plant polycultures. Nitrogen addition had small negative effects on AM fungal spore abundance and species richness in 2000. The interaction of CO2 and N did not affect arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spore communities. * • We show that CO2 enrichment and plant species richness impact arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community structure. These findings are important because altered symbiotic functioning may result.},

abstract = {1. Our aim was to explore plant–soil feedback in mixed grassland communities and its significance for plant productivity and community composition relative to abiotic factors of soil type and fertility. 2. We carried out a 4-year, field-based mesocosm experiment to determine the relative effects of soil type, historic management intensity and soil conditioning by a wide range of plant species of mesotrophic grassland on the productivity and evenness of subsequent mixed communities. 3. The study consisted of an initial soil conditioning phase, whereby soil from two locations each with two levels of management intensity was conditioned with monocultures of nine grassland species, and a subsequent feedback phase, where mixed communities of the nine species were grown in conditioned soil to determine relative effects of experimental factors on the productivity and evenness of mixed communities and individual plant species performance. 4. In the conditioning phase of the experiment, individual plant species differentially influenced soil microbial communities and nutrient availability. However, these biotic effects were much less important as drivers of soil microbial properties and nutrient availability than were abiotic factors of soil type and fertility. 5. Significant feedback effects of conditioning were detected during the second phase of the study in terms of individual plant growth in mixed communities. These feedback effects were generally independent of soil type or fertility, and were consistently negative in nature. In most cases, individual plant species performed less well in mixed communities planted in soil that had previously supported their own species. 6. Synthesis. These findings suggest that despite soil abiotic factors acting as major drivers of soil microbial communities and nutrient availability, biotic interactions in the form of negative feedback play a significant role in regulating individual plant performance in mixed grassland communities across a range of soil conditions.},

abstract = {Single-stage constructed wetlands (CWs) are characterized by a low potential for N removal. Understanding the pathways regulating N cycling as well as their dependence on environmental variables might improve the potential of CWs for N removal and results in more accurate simulation tools. In this study we employed qPCR targeting marker functional genes (amoA, nirK, nirS, clade I and II nosZ) or microorganisms (anammox) regulating key pathways of N cycling to unravel their relative importance. Furthermore, the influence of plant species on treatment performance was studied. Our findings indicated nitrification-denitrification as the principal route of N removal in CWs, while anammox did not have a strong contribution. Evidence was also arisen that ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) contributed on NH3oxidation. Overall, plant species had a weak effect on the abundance of N functional genes (amoA of AOA), but it strongly affected the performance of CWs in terms of N removal in the following order: unplanted {\textless} Phragmites communis {\textless} Typha latifolia. These findings suggest that plant species stimulate N removal by upregulating the rates that the responsible biochemical pathways operate, probably by increasing O2supply. In addition, our study revealed differences in indicators linked to N2O emissions. The abundance of clade II nosZ genes remained low across the season scaling down a strong contribution in the reduction of the emitted N2O. The increasing ratios of nosZ/$\sigma$nir and nirS/nirK with the progress of season indicate a shift in the composition of denitrifiers towards strains with a lower genetic potential for N2O release. Similar trends were observed among the treatments but the mechanisms differed. The planted treatments stimulated an increase in the $\sigma$nosZ/$\sigma$nir ratio, while the unplanted an increase in the nirS/nirK ratio.},

While this$\backslash$npattern of associational resistance is frequently reported, experimental$\backslash$nevidence for underlying mechanisms is rare particularly for potential$\backslash$nplant species diversity effects on focal host plants and their physical$\backslash$nenvironment. Here, we used an established forest diversity experiment to$\backslash$ndetermine whether tree diversity effects on an important insect pest are$\backslash$ndriven by concomitant changes in host tree growth or the light$\backslash$nenvironment. We examined the effects of tree species richness, canopy$\backslash$ncover and tree growth on the probability of occurrence, the abundance,$\backslash$nand volume of galls caused by the pineapple gall adelgid Adelges abietis$\backslash$non Norway spruce. Although tree diversity had no effect on gall$\backslash$nabundance, we observed that both the probability of gall presence and$\backslash$ngall volume (an indicator of maternal fecundity) decreased with tree$\backslash$nspecies richness and canopy cover around host spruce trees. Structural$\backslash$nequation models revealed that effects of tree species richness on gall$\backslash$npresence and volume were mediated by concurrent increases in canopy$\backslash$ncover rather than changes in tree growth or host tree density. As canopy$\backslash$ncover did not influence tree or shoot growth, patterns of associational$\backslash$nresistance appear to be driven by improved host tree quality or more$\backslash$nfavourable microclimatic conditions in monocultures compared to$\backslash$nmixed-stands. Our study therefore demonstrates that changes in forest$\backslash$nstructure may be critical to understanding the responses of herbivores$\backslash$nto plant diversity and may underpin associational effects in forest$\backslash$necosystems.},

Trin. ex Steudel and two cyperacean species, viz. Scirpus maritimus L. and S. lacustris L.) was studied in relation to growth responses in the water-depth gradient. Stands of S. lacustris were found at lower depths relative to the mean water level (average fringe depth 69 ± 19 cm) than stands of Phragmites australis (av. 45 ± 20 cm), S. maritimus (av. 36 ± 8 cm) and Phalaris arundinacea (av. 25 ± 8 cm). The growth responses to a gradient of water depth were studied by planting the four species at five distinct water depths in outdoor basins, and determining morphological parameters and biomass distributions of the species grown for two consecutive years. The biomass of Phalaris arundinacea was reduced below 30 cm water depth, while Phragmites australis and S. maritimus showed reduced biomass at 80 cm water depth. S. lacustris showed no biomass reduction even at 80 cm water depth. An increased above-ground: below-ground biomass ratio in deeper water was demonstrated for each of the species under study; however, the modification of biomass distribution in the gramineous species occurred abruptly in very shallow water contrary to the cyperacean species. Mean basal stem diameter increased with water depth in all four species. Mean stem length increased with water depth in three of the four species. Stem elongation with increasing water depth was strongest in the cyperacean species. The gramineous species showed enhanced formation of adventitious roots at submerged nodes. The similarity of responses to water depth was greatest within each of the groups of gramineous and cyperacean species. The responses reflect the zonation of the species along the water- depth gradient: S. lacustris in relatively deep water. Phragmites australis and S. maritimus in shallower water, and Phalaris arundinacea in very shallow water.},

abstract = {Studies manipulating predator diversity and measuring the impact on herbivore abun- dance have found that enhancing predator species richness often increases the strength of prey suppression. This relationship may be due to mechanisms such as complementarity or facilitation, which are considered “true” beneÞts of diversity because greater prey suppression is an emergent property of the multispecies predator community.Oritmaybe due to an identity effect, an “apparent” beneÞt of diversity that results from the greater likelihood of including one particularly voracious predator species as the total number of predator species increases. In separate greenhouse and Þeld experiments, we simultaneously manipulated the species richness and species composition of pred- ators attacking bird cherry-oat aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi) (L.) on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We found that on average aphid suppression by species-rich predator assemblages was greater than suppressionbysingle-species monocultures. However, the performance of individual predator species varied and the species-rich assemblages did not outperform all single-species compositions, suggesting an identity effect. In particular, single-species compositions of the lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) exhibited high performance across experiments, and on average predator assemblages that contained a lady beetle predator had lower overall aphid abundance than compositions where lady beetles were absent. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the dominant role of lady beetles, especially C. maculata, in natural pest suppression and suggest that predator species com- position and identity are important factors to consider in efforts to conserve this valuable ecosystem service.

abstract = {Green roofs are often planted with multiple species to improve aesthetics and other ecosystem services. If diverse species mixtures contain species with phenological differences in growth and reproduction, this could enhance ecosystem functioning by increasing the duration over which a valuable process operates. Phenological complementarity describes a species mixture where plant growth or reproduction is more evenly spread over time among species than predicted by chance. Here we report general phenological patterns of growth and reproduction from the third year of a four-year modular green roof experiment involving 13 species from five life form groups, planted in mixtures and monocultures. The relationships between phenological complementarity in canopy density (a surrogate for aboveground biomass) in species mixtures and thermal and hydrological functions were determined for the fourth year of the study.Timing of peak growth occurred from May to July, differing greatly among species. Flowering times also differed among species and occurred from May to October. Six species showed variation in phenology depending on whether they were planted in monocultures or species mixtures, suggesting competitive or facilitative interactions with other species. Phenological complementarity in canopy density was observed in four of the species mixture treatments, with mixtures of species from the same life form tending to have the highest complementarity values. Phenological complementarity was weakly negatively correlated with the temporal coefficient of variation in stormwater capture, indicating the potential for greater process stability over time in complementary mixtures.},

abstract = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, espe- cially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linearmodel. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly fromthemodel. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable inmagni- tude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often themore interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treat- ment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly froma linearmodel.This provides a sim- ple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningfulmodels that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linearmodels (GLM) and linear mixedmodels.},

abstract = {The importance of species diversity to emergent, ecological properties of communities is increasingly appreciated, but the importance of within-species genetic diversity for analogous emergent properties of populations is only just becoming apparent. Here, the properties and effects of genetic variation on predation resistance in populations were assessed and the molecular mechanism underlying these emergent effects was investigated. Using biofilms of the ubiquitous bacterium Serratia marcescens, we tested the importance of genetic diversity in defending biofilms against protozoan grazing, a main source of mortality for bacteria in all natural ecosystems. S. marcescens biofilms established from wild-type cells produce heritable, stable variants, which when experimentally combined, persist as a diverse assemblage and are significantly more resistant to grazing than either wild type or variant biofilms grown in monoculture. This diversity effect is biofilm-specific, a result of either facilitation or resource partitioning among variants, with equivalent experiments using planktonic cultures and grazers resulting in dominance by a single resistant strain. The variants studied are all the result of single nucleotide polymorphisms in one regulatory gene suggesting that the benefits of genetic diversity in clonal biofilms can occur through remarkably minimal genetic change. The findings presented here provide a new insight on the integration of genetics and population ecology, in which diversity arising through minimal changes in genotype can have major ecological implications for natural populations.},

A nutrient treatment that mimicked single-resident domestic effluent consisted of two levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [low (56 mg/l N and 31 mg/l P) and high (112 mg/l N and 62 mg/l P)] of nutrient solution applied three times weekly. The plants were established and maintained for one year before the nutrient treatment and monthly water sampling commenced; water sampling began July 31, 2001 and ended October 23, 2001. We tested four hypotheses: (1) vegetated microcosms are more effective at reducing concentrations of total N and total P from soil leachate than unvegetated, (2) there is a differential species effect on the potential to reduce N and P, (3) plant mixtures are more effective than monocultures at reducing N and P, and (4) the microcosms will be least effective at reducing N and P concentrations in October compared to August. We found support for hypotheses 1, 2, and 4, but our results are inconclusive for the third hypothesis. Total N and total P in the soil leachate were significantly higher from unvegetated microcosms compared to vegetated. S. validus was most effective and P. arundinacea was generally least effective at reducing N and P in monocultures, with treatment capabilities similar to unvegetated microcosms. The four-species mixture was generally highly effective at nutrient removal, however the results were not significantly different from the monocultures. At the end of the growing season (October) treatment efficiency was significantly less than earlier months, especially for the unvegetated treatment. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We collected using pan trapping and estimated the landscape composition of the sites within a 500 m radius and the species richness of plant assemblages within a 200 m radius. We collected 1104 bees from 74 species. The proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale had a negative effect on wild bee abundance and species richness, whereas local flower composition had no effect. Ground-nesting bees were particularly sensitive to the urbanization gradient. This study provides new evidences of the impact of urbanization on bee assemblages and the proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale emerged as a key factor that drives those assemblages.},

abstract = {The rate at which a plant species is attacked by invertebrate herbivores has been hypothesized to depend on plant species richness, yet empirical evidence is scarce. Current theory predicts higher herbivore damage in monocultures than in species-rich mixtures. We quantified herbivore damage by insects and molluscs to plants in experimental plots established in 2002 from a species pool of 60 species of Central European Arrhenatherum grasslands. Plots differed in plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 60 species), number of functional groups (1, 2, 3, 4), functional group and species composition. We estimated herbivore damage by insects and molluscs at the level of transplanted plant individuals ("phytometer" species Plantago lanceolata, Trifolium pratense, Rumex acetosa) and of the entire plant community during 2003 and 2004. In contrast to previous studies, our design allows specific predictions about the relative contributions of functional diversity, plant functional identity, and species richness in relation to herbivory. Additionally, the phytometer approach is new to biodiversity-herbivory studies, allowing estimates of species-specific herbivory rates within the larger biodiversity-ecosystem functioning context. Herbivory in phytometers and experimental communities tended to increase with plant species richness and the number of plant functional groups, but the effects were rarely significant. Herbivory in phytometers was in some cases positively correlated with community biomass or leaf area index. The most important factor influencing invertebrate herbivory was the presence of particular plant functional groups. Legume (grass) presence strongly increased (decreased) herbivory at the community level. The opposite pattern was found for herbivory in T. pratense phytometers. We conclude that (1) plant species richness is much less important than previously thought and (2) plant functional identity is a much better predictor of invertebrate herbivory in temperate grassland ecosystems.},

abstract = {*$\backslash$nAfforestation is globally increasing to produce timber and pulp wood, but also to enhance ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, nutrient retention or groundwater recharge. In China, large areas have been and will be afforested in order to compensate for the negative impacts of former clear-cuttings and to make use of the ecosystem services associated with afforestation. In order to further optimize these services with regard to balanced nutrient (particularly nitrogen) cycles, it is important to know whether the use of mixtures of native tree species in afforestation projects promotes the acquisition and retention of nitrogen compared with the currently established large-scale monocultures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nTo test the effect of species richness on system N retention and tree sapling N uptake, we conducted a 15N tracer experiment in a young tree plantation.

This study provides evidence that mixed afforestation promotes N retention from the sapling stage. To further improve ecosystem services associated with afforestation, we strongly suggest the use of mixtures of native tree species instead of monocultures. Mixtures of four species may reduce system N losses and thus may lessen groundwater contamination due to N leaching. We encourage further investigations to find optimal species combinations that promote a wide range of ecosystem services related to more closed nutrient cycles and minimized soil erosion. In our study, the plantations' capability to retain N could be optimized by means of both increasing tree species richness and by choosing the optimal species combinations.},

Reduced biodiversity has raised numerous concerns, including the possibility that ecosystem functioning may be affected negatively, which might be particularly important in the face of other global changes. Here we present results of a grassland field experiment in Minnesota, USA, that tests the hypothesis that plant diversity and composition influence the enhancement of biomass and carbon acquisition in ecosystems subjected to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition. The study experimentally controlled plant diversity (1, 4, 9 or 16 species), soil nitrogen (unamended versus deposition of 4 g of nitrogen per m2 per yr) and atmospheric CO2 concentrations using free-air CO2 enrichment (ambient, 368 micromol mol-1, versus elevated, 560 micromol mol-1). We found that the enhanced biomass accumulation in response to elevated levels of CO2 or nitrogen, or their combination, is less in species-poor than in species-rich assemblages.},

abstract = {Extreme temperatures are a main factor limiting plant growth in high mountain habitats. During winter, the risk of frost damage is highest at windblown and often snow-free sites. During summer, actively growing plants are particularly endangered by episodic cold spells, but also by short-term overheating. The current review gives an overview of extreme temperatures in the European Alps and observations of temperature damage on plants in their natural habitats. Furthermore, seasonal time courses of frost and heat resistance derived from laboratory tests on different plant growth forms are presented. Study species were the cushion plants Silene acaulis, Minuartia sedoides, Saxifraga oppositifolia and Carex firma collected on wind-exposed ridges; the rosette plant Soldanella alpina collected on snow-protected sites, and three Sempervivum species collected in xerothermic habitats. The temperature resistance of leaves, stems, rhizomes and roots were tested in two annual time courses. Frost treatments were conducted in controlled freezers by rapid cooling (10 K h-1, for current resistance) as well as by stepwise cooling (1-3 K h-1, for hardening capacity). Heat treatments followed a standardised procedure by exposing samples to heat for 30 min in hot water baths. The damage was visually estimated using the topographic tetrazolium test. During winter, cushion plants from exposed sites were fully hardened (LT50below -70 °C). Rosette plants, which are protected by a constant snow cover, survived temperatures of down to -25 °C. During the growing period, foliage and shoot tips of the investigated species were damaged at -5 to -8 °C (LT50). Stems and rhizomes were only partially damaged by temperatures of -10 to -15 °C. Heat resistance in cushion plants generally reached 56-58 °C (LT50), shoots and rhizomes of C. firma could reach 60 °C. Succulent plants like Sempervivum arachnoideum and S. tectorum from hot and dry microsites were the most heat resistant among the tested species (62-64 °C). The investigated mountain plant species showed highly varying resistance patterns, with variation in maximum hardening capability and seasonal time courses of resistance. Plants were capable of rapid adjustments to extreme temperatures, which is crucial for survival in a high mountain climate. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we evaluated the process of Phragmites encroachment into Phalaris stands in two constructed wetlands with horizontal subsurface flow. The results revealed that 50{\%} of the area originally planted with Phalaris was overgrown by Phragmites in 5 and 9 years in the monitored systems while the complete elimination of Phalaris occurred after 9 and 13 years. Replacement of Phalaris did not have any effect on removal of BOD5and COD while removal efficiency of TSS increased after Phalaris was replaced with Phragmites. However, it is difficult to determine out whether replacement was the only reason for better TSS removal.},

abstract = {Biofiltration systems are a recommended and increasingly popular technology for stormwater management; however there is a general lack of performance data for these systems, particularly at the field scale. The objective of this study was to investigate the hydrologic and pollutant removal performance of three field-scale biofiltration systems in two different climates. Biofilters were shown to effectively attenuate peak runoff flow rates by at least 80{\%}. Performance assessment of a lined biofilter demonstrated that retention of inflow volumes by the filter media, for subsequent loss via evapotranspiration, reduced runoff volumes by 33{\%} on average. Retention of water was found to be most influenced by inflow volumes, although only small to medium storms could be assessed. Vegetation was shown to be important for maintaining hydraulic capacity, because root growth and senescence countered compaction and clogging. Suspended solids and heavy metals were effectively removed, irrespective of the design configuration, with load reductions generally in excess of 90{\%}. In contrast, nutrient retention was variable, and ranged from consistent leaching to effective and reliable removal, depending on the design. To ensure effective removal of phosphorus, a filter medium with a low phosphorus content should be selected. Nitrogen is more difficult to remove because it is highly soluble and strongly influenced by the variable wetting and drying regime that is inherent in biofilter operation. The results of this research suggest that reconfiguration of biofilter design to manage the deleterious effects of drying on biological activity is necessary to ensure long term nitrogen removal.

abstract = {Communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in five agricultural field sites of different management intensities were studied. Variable regions of the ribosomal RNA genes were used to detect and identify AMF directly within colonized roots. Roots from a continuous maize monoculture showed low AMF diversity, in agreement with previous reports on molecular diversity of AMF in agricultural soils. In contrast, a substantially higher diversity of AMF was found throughout the long term 'DOK' field experiment, where organic and conventional agricultural practices have been compared side by side since 1978. In this experiment, a 7-year crop rotation is performed under lower levels of inorganic fertilizer input and chemical pest control. These results are in good agreement with analyses of the spore community previously conducted in these field sites. In a third site, an organically managed leek field with soil of very high phosphate content reflecting the highly intensive conventional field history and intensive tillage, we detected a low-diversity community comparable to the maize monoculture. In addition to fungi from Glomus group A, which have previously been reported to dominate arable soils, we regularly found members of the genera Scutellospora, Paraglomus and Acaulospora. The genus Acaulospora was shown to occur more frequently early in the growing season, suggesting that the life history strategy of AMF may influence the active community at a given time. These data show that the diversity of AMF is not always low in arable soils. Furthermore, low-input agriculture involving crop rotation may provide better conditions to preserve AMF diversity, by preventing the selection for the few AMF taxa tolerating high nutrient levels.},

abstract = {The San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary (SJWS), Irvine, CA, is a 32 ha series of shallow ponds created to maximize nitrate removal rates while maintaining 90{\%} open water and episodically exposed shoreline for avian habitat. Design elements created non-ideal denitrification conditions by diminishing an organic carbon source (emergent vegetation) and increasing sediment exposure to oxygen. SJWS aqueous nitrogen and avian data (1999-2002) were analyzed to discern whether design and operating conditions allowed for simultaneous nitrate removal and diverse, abundant avian habitat. Average TIN removal efficiency was 80{\%} while average TN removal efficiency was 60{\%}; the difference reflects Org-N production in the marsh. Based on Chl-a measurements, roughly 40{\%} of Org-N produced in the system was present as algae. The highest annual nitrate removal rates occurred April-May (350-500 mg/m2/d) and September-October (250-425 mg/m2/d). First order rate constants ranged 30.7-47.5 m year-1. Seasonal plantings of barnyard grass (Echinocloa crus-galli) were intended to serve as a carbon amendment for denitrification, however, there was no difference in nitrate removal between amended and non-amended conditions, likely because data averaging obscured a small, localized enhancement signal. Average avian species richness was high, ranging between 65 and 76 species month-1, while average relative abundance was mid-range, at 65-83 birds ha-1month-1. Birds observed included common and rare species. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Green walls offer multiple benefits to urban environments, but they are major water consumers and not optimal for use in dry climates. If green walls were engineered to treat greywater, they could become cost-effective and more widespread. However, it is not clear what impact watering green walls with greywater has on the life cycle of plants and media types, so each element needs to be assessed and optimised. This work presents the first step, by testing a range of potentially suitable media: (1) hydraulically slow coir, rockwool and fyto-foam, and (2) hydraulically fast perlite, vermiculite, growstone, expended clay and river sand. An unvegetated column experiment was conducted over two months with accelerated greywater dosing to assess the hydraulic and pollutant removal performance. The two best performing media were then further tested to identify the underlying pollutant removal processes. Slow media showed higher and more consistent pollutant removal performance than Fast media, averaging around 90{\%}, 50{\%}, 30{\%}, 70{\%} and 80{\%} removal of total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) respectively. However, Slow media were prone to clogging and therefore unsuitable as the sole media in greywater green walls. Fast media exhibited on average around 80{\%}, 30{\%}, 15{\%}, 30{\%} and 20{\%} of TSS, TN, TP, COD and E. coli removal respectively, with no measurable clogging issues. Perlite was found to have the best hydraulic and treatment performance among the Fast media while coco coir was the best Slow media. Biological processes were found to be the dominant mechanism for nitrogen and COD removal in coir, which provided sufficient retention time for denitrification processes. For perlite, with lower retention times, physico-chemical processes dominated removal, showing the importance of media properties. Biological processes significantly contributed to TP removal in all tested media types. This study shows a significant difference in the processes that govern the pollutant removal performance of coir and perlite media and suggests that a combination of both might prove to be the best option for their optimal application in green walls for greywater reuse systems.},

abstract = {As biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, an important current scientific challenge is to understand and predict the consequences of biodiversity loss. Here, we develop a theory that predicts the temporal variability of community biomass from the properties of individual component species in monoculture. Our theory shows that biodiversity stabilises ecosystems through three main mechanisms: (1) asynchrony in species' responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) reduced demographic stochasticity due to overyielding in species mixtures and (3) reduced observation error (including spatial and sampling variability). Parameterised with empirical data from four long-term grassland biodiversity experiments, our prediction explained 22–75{\%} of the observed variability, and captured much of the effect of species richness. Richness stabilised communities mainly by increasing community biomass and reducing the strength of demographic stochasticity. Our approach calls for a re-evaluation of the mechanisms explaining the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem stability.},

abstract = {Constructed ecosystems such as green roofs often contain monocultures or low-diversity plant communities, but adding more plant species to these systems can increase ecosystem service provisioning. Mixture advantage, when species-rich treatments outperform the best monocultures, is desirable in constructed ecosystems due to the cost of increasing diversity. However, there have not been any studies in constructed ecosystems that have quantitatively compared mixtures with the best monocultures for multifunctionality, and there have been few studies that have examined how provision of ecosystem services changes over time as plant communities develop. In a green roof system, I predicted (i) that the mixture advantage would be stronger for ecosystem multifunctionality than for single ecosystem functions and (ii) that ecosystem service provisioning and complementarity in above-ground biomass would increase over time. Fifteen monocultures of plant species from five life-form groups (succulents, tall forbs, dwarf shrubs, creeping forbs, grasses) were compared with three-species mixtures of the same life-form and mixtures of species from three and five different life-forms in a modular green roof system. Indicators of ecosystem services including above-ground production, thermal regulation, stormwater retention, nutrient uptake and carbon sequestration and two indices of ecosystem multifunctionality were compared. Canopy density increased over time while substrate temperature decreased, suggesting higher provisioning of valuable ecosystem services. For single services, the positive relationship between planted species richness and ecosystem service grew stronger over time, but was consistently strong over time for multifunctionality. Quantile regression indicated a weak mixture advantage for several services including both multifunctionality indices. While the effects were small, different species optimized different functions, thus multifunctioning is enhanced in more diverse mixtures by combining species that maximize different functions. Tripartite partitioning of canopy density showed that overyielding and trait-independent complementarity fluctuated between years in response to shifts in species abundances, but dominance and trait-dependent complementarity increased over time. Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first evidence in a constructed ecosystem that mixtures can outperform the best monocultures for multiple ecosystem services. Mixtures of plant life-forms can improve green roof performance. The biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships observed in natural ecosystems can also occur in novel and highly simplified engineered ecosystems.

abstract = {Rooftop gardening (or green roof establishment) is an urban greening afforestation method that has many environmental, economic, and urban landscaping benefits. For rooftop vegetation, stressful environments that include heat, strong winds, sunshine, and drought prevent many plants from growing well, especially in shallow soil. To establish low cost urban rooftop gardens with a low weight substrate in the summer, we evaluated the green coverage and growth of a suitable groundcover ornamental plant, blue daze (Evolvulus pilosus). Blue daze was used as rooftop vegetation in a shallow substrate (10. cm thick) on the flat rooftop of a four-story building in the middle of Kobe city, Japan, which has a temperate and humid climate. On average, the diurnal maximum temperatures and the total amounts of precipitation during each planting experiment between July and September were 30.8. ??C and 247. mm in 2008 and 33.2. ??C and 458. mm in 2009, respectively. Three different types of planting substrates (AS, amended soil, TM, turf mat as a dried-up blocks of sod, and FBA, furnace bottom ash) were tested to determine how they influenced plant cover, flowering, and growth. We evaluated the physical and chemical properties of the substrates that were used to establish the rooftop greeneries. In addition, the economy, ornamental and ecological values, reuse of material, and low rooftop weight burdens of the substrates were evaluated. The greatest blue daze ground cover occurred on the TM substrate (relative to the AS and FBA substrates) approximately three months after transplanting. The blue daze actively bloomed on all substrates throughout midsummer. However, alternate day irrigation largely reduced their shoot growth and flowering relative to daily irrigation. The AS and TM substrates had suitable physicochemical properties for use as planting substrates and had ideal solid, liquid, and vapor phase distributions and high water and nutrient holding capacities. FBA was a poor substrate with very low water and nutrient retention capacities, which resulted in depressed plant growth, especially under low watering conditions. To recycle FBA efficiently as a shallow low-cost planting substrate for rooftop gardening, the addition of coated fertilizers and organic matter to FBA should be considered to improve its water and nutrient holding capacities. ?? 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

We manipulated the species richness of herbivores and predators in an experimental benthic marine community and measured their effects on predator, herbivore and primary producer performance. Predator composition and richness strongly affected several community and population responses, mostly via sampling effects. However, some predators survived better in polycultures than in monocultures, suggesting complementarity due to stronger intra- than interspecific interactions. Predator effects also differed between additive and substitutive designs, emphasizing that the relationship between diversity and abundance in an assemblage can strongly influence whether and how diversity effects are realized. Changing herbivore richness and predator richness interacted to influence both total herbivore abundance and predatory crab growth, but these interactive diversity effects were weak. Overall, the presence and richness of predators dominated biotic effects on community and ecosystem properties.},

The aim of many such experiments is to compare the phenotype of different species or genotypes in a specific environment, or to study plant performance under a range of suboptimal conditions. Our paper aims to bring together the minimum knowledge necessary for a plant biologist to set up such experiments and apply the environmental conditions that are appropriate to answer the questions of interest. We first focus on the basic choices that have to be made with regard to the experimental setup (e.g. where are the plants grown; what rooting medium; what pot size). Second, we present practical considerations concerning the number of plants that have to be analysed considering the variability in plant material and the required precision. Third, we discuss eight of the most important environmental factors for plant growth (light quantity, light quality, CO2, nutrients, air humidity, water, temperature and salinity); what critical issues should be taken into account to ensure proper growth conditions in controlled environments and which specific aspects need attention if plants are challenged with a certain a-biotic stress factor. Finally, we propose a simple checklist that could be used for tracking and reporting experimental conditions.},

If published studies are chosen, say through a literature review, then an inherent selection bias may arise, because, for example, studies may tend to be published more readily if they are statistically significant, or deemed to be more "interesting" in terms of the impact of their outcomes. We develop a simple rank-based data augmentation technique, formalizing the use of funnel plots, to estimate and adjust for the numbers and outcomes of missing studies. Several nonparametric estimators are proposed for the number of missing studies, and their properties are developed analytically and through simulations.

abstract = {1. Although there is ample support for positive species richness–productivity relationships in planted grassland experiments, a recent 48-site study found no diversity–productivity relationship (DPR) in herbaceous communities. Thus, debate persists about diversity effects in natural versus planted systems. Additionally, current knowledge is weak regarding the influence of evenness on theDPRs, howDPRs are affected by the variation in life-history traitsamong constituent species in polycultures and how DPRs differ among biomes. The impacts of these factors on DPRs in forest ecosystems are evenmore poorly understood. 2. We performed a meta-analysis of 54 studies to reconcile DPRs in forest ecosystems. We quanti- fied the net diversity effect as log effect size [ln(ES)], the log ratio of the productivity in polycultures to the average of those in monocultures within the same type of mixture, site condition and stand age of each study. The first use of a boosted regression treemodel in meta-analysis, a useful method to partition the effects of multiple predictors rather than relying on vote-counting of individual studies, unveiled the relative influences of individual predictors. 3. Global average ln(ES) was 0.2128, indicating 23.7{\%} higher productivity in polycultures than monocultures. The final model explained 21{\%}of the variation in ln(ES). The predictors that sub- stantially accounted for the explained variation included evenness (34{\%}), heterogeneity of shade tolerance (29{\%}), richness (13{\%}) and stand age (15{\%}). In contrast, heterogeneity of nitrogen fixa- tion and growth habits, biome and stand origin (naturally established versus planted) contributed negligibly (each {\pounds}4{\%}). Log effect size strongly increased with evenness from0.6 to 1 and with rich- ness from 2 to 6. Furthermore, it was higher with heterogeneity of shade tolerance and generally increasedwith stand age. 4. Synthesis. Our analysis is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the critical role of species evenness, richness and the importance of contrasting traits in defining net diversity effects in forest polycultures. While testing the specific mechanisms is beyond the scope of our analysis, our results should motivate future studies to link richness, evenness, contrasting traits and life-history stage to the mechanisms that are expected to produce positive net biodiversity effects such as niche differen- tiation, facilitation and reduced Janzen–Connell effects.},

abstract = {This paper presents, for the first time, evidence to show that Calluna species are one causative factor of piping in blanket peat catchments. Ground-penetrating radar survey on 960 plots illustrated that piping was prevalent throughout blanket peats. However, soil pipe occurrence was significantly higher where bare peat (149 pipes/ km) or Calluna (87 pipes/ km) were present compared to other species (67 pipes/ km). A case study catchment where there was an altitudinal limit to Calluna provided some control over potential factors that may lead to an association between piping and Calluna. Under the controlled conditions of topographic index, peat depth, and water table, piping was greater under the Calluna-covered peat than under other vegetation covers. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that 10 years worth of rainfall was enough to almost double the proportion of macropore flow occurring in recently colonized Calluna peatlands. This suggests that given enough water and time, the woody Calluna plants result in water being preferentially channeled through the upper peat. Improvements are therefore required in our understanding of the relationships between peatland plant nutrient and water supply and the feedbacks between ecosystem functioning and landform development. These results are also important given the propensity to encourage Calluna growth for game bird enhancement in many northern peatlands.},

We determined the effect of species richness and composition on establishment and initial biomass production of native plant polycultures. Twelve treatments with varying levels of species richness (1-24 species) were established. Establishment success and yield varied over eight locations. The number of species established in polyculture increased linearly as the number of species seeded increased. Average biomass yield ranged from 1.2 to 6.0 Mg ha(-1) with the highest yielding treatments being grass monocultures or an eight species grass legume mixture. An increase in species richness from one to eight species increased yield an average of 28{\%}, but increasing species richness from 8 to 12 or 24 species had no yield advantage at most locations. Early successional species, Canada milkvetch (Astragalus canadensis L.) and Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximilian Schrad.), were dominant in mixtures and contributed a majority of the biomass to the yield. Even in high diversity plots, biomass was from only a few plant species with a single species dominating the mixture. Our results suggest that selected low diversity mixtures (one to five species) likely offer the best combination of species establishment and high yield during stand establishment. However, we expect that early successional species that were dominant during the establishment phase of our experiment will contribute less biomass as stands mature and later successional species will become dominant and provide greater biomass.},

abstract = {Green roofs alter the surface energy balance and can help in mitigating urban heat islands. However, the cooling of green roofs due to evapotranspiration strongly depends on the climatic conditions, and vegetation type and density. In the Southern Central Plains of the United States, extreme weather events, such as high winds, heat waves and drought conditions pose challenges for successful implementation of green roofs, and likely alter their standard performance. The National Weather Center Experimental Green Roof, an interdisciplinary research site established in 2010 in Norman, OK, aimed to investigate the ecological performance and surface energy balance of green roof systems.Starting in May 2010, 26. months of vegetation studies were conducted and the radiation balance, air temperature, relative humidity, and buoyancy fluxes were monitored at two meteorological stations during April-October 2011. The establishment of a vegetative community trended towards prairie plant dominance. High mortality of succulents and low germination of grasses and herbaceous plants contributed to low vegetative coverage. In this condition succulent diversity declined. Bouteloua gracilis and Delosperma cooperi showed typological dominance in harsh climatic conditions, while Sedum species experienced high mortality. The plant community diversified through volunteers such as Euphorbia maculate and Portulaca maculate. Net radiation measured at a green-roof meteorological station was higher than at a control station over the original, light-colored roofing material. These findings indicate that the albedo of the green roof was lower than the albedo of the original roofing material. The low vegetative coverage during the heat and drought conditions in 2011, which resulted in the dark substrate used in the green roof containers being exposed, likely contributed to the low albedo values. Nevertheless, air temperatures and buoyancy fluxes were often lower over the green roof indicating that higher evapotranspiration rates compensated for the higher net radiation at the green roof.},

abstract = {Ecological interactions between aboveground and belowground biodiversity have received many attentions in the recent decades. Although soil biodiversity declined with the decrease of plant diversity, many previous studies found plant species identities were more important than plant diversity in controlling soil biodiversity. This study focused on the responses of soil biodiversity to the altering of plant functional groups, namely overstory and understory vegetations, rather than plant diversity gradient. We conducted an experiment by removing overstory and/or understory vegetation to compare their effects on soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and nematode diversities in eucalyptus monocultures. Our results indicated that both overstory and understory vegetations could affect soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities, which manifested as the decrease in Shannon–Wiener diversity index (H′) and Pielou evenness index (J) and the increase in Simpson dominance index ($\lambda$) after vegetation removal. Soil microclimate change explained part of variance of soil biodiversity indices. Both overstory and understory vegetations positively correlated with soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities. In addition, the alteration of soil biodiversity might be due to a mixing effect of bottom-up control and soil microclimate change after vegetation removal in the studied plantations. Given the studied ecosystem is common in humid subtropical and tropical region of the world, our findings might have great potential to extrapolate to large scales and could be conducive to ecosystem management and service.

abstract = {As urbanisation increases globally and the natural environment becomes increasingly fragmented, the importance of urban green spaces for biodiversity conservation grows. In many countries, private gardens are a major component of urban green space and can provide considerable biodiversity benefits. Gardens and adjacent habitats form interconnected networks and a landscape ecology framework is necessary to understand the relationship between the spatial configuration of garden patches and their constituent biodiversity. A scale-dependent tension is apparent in garden management, whereby the individual garden is much smaller than the unit of management needed to retain viable populations. To overcome this, here we suggest mechanisms for encouraging 'wildlife-friendly' management of collections of gardens across scales from the neighbourhood to the city. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Intensive forest management (IFM) promises to help satisfy increasing global demand for wood but may come at the cost of local reductions to forest biodiversity. IFM often reduces early seral plant diversity as a result of efforts to eliminate plant competition with crop trees. If diversity is a function of bottom-up drivers, theory predicts that specialists at lower trophic levels (e.g., insect herbivores) should be particularly sensitive to reductions in plant diversity. We conducted a stand-level experiment to test bottom-up controls on moth community structure, as mediated by degrees of forest management intensity. Using a dataset of 12,003 moths representing 316 moth species, moth richness decreased only slightly, if at all, as herbicide intensity increased (P = 0.062); the moderate treatment, which is most commonly applied in the northwestern USA, was estimated to have 4.72 (±2.14 SE, P = 0.039) fewer species than the control. Structural equation modeling revealed strong support for an effect of herbicide on plant abundance, which influenced plant species richness and subsequently moth species richness. Moth species richness was associated with plant species richness and followed a power law function (z = 0.42, P = 0.006), which is surprisingly consistent with a recent large-scale experiment in agricultural systems, and provides support for bottom-up drivers of moth community structure. Moth abundance was not influenced by the direct effects of silvicultural herbicide treatments. Site-level effects and variation in pre-harvest vegetation communities resulted in residual broadleaf and herbaceous vegetation in even the most intensive treatment. Even at low densities, these residual deciduous and herbaceous plants supported higher than expected moth abundance and richness. We conclude that forest management practices that retain early seral vegetation diversity are the most likely to conserve moth communities.},

abstract = {The relationship between plant diversity and productivity in grasslands could depend, partly, on how diversity affects vertical distributions of root biomass in soil; yet, no prior study has evaluated the links among diversity, root depth distributions, and productivity in a long-term experiment. We used data from a 12-year experiment to ask how plant species richness and composition influenced both observed and expected root depth distributions of plant communities. Expected root depth distributions were based on the abundance of species in each community and two traits of species that were measured in monocultures: root depth distributions and root-to-shoot ratios. The observed proportion of deep-root biomass increased more than expected with species richness and was positively correlated with aboveground productivity. Indeed, the proportion of deep-root biomass explained variation in productivity even after accounting for legume presence/abundance and greater nitrogen availability in diverse plots. Diverse plots had root depth distributions that were twice as deep as expected from their species composition and corresponding monoculture traits, partly due to interactions between C4 grasses and legumes. These results suggest that the productivity of diverse plant communities was partly dependent on belowground plant interactions that caused roots to be distributed more deeply in soil.},

abstract = {Understanding how soil microbial communities influence plant interactions with other organisms, and how this varies with characteristics of the interacting organisms, is important for multiple systems. Solanum spp. are a suitable model for trophic interactions in studies of agricultural and natural systems and can also provide useful corollaries in invaded systems. This study examined the influence of soil mutualist arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on growth of different Solanum types fed on by the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae, in relation to the presence of the aphid facultative endosymbiont Hamiltonella defensa. Four Solanum types comprising two wild species, S. berthaultii and S. polyadenum, and two accessions of S. tuberosum, were grown with or without AM fungi and infested with one of four clonal lines of a single M. euphorbiae genotype (two with and two without H. defensa). Two experiments were conducted to (i) characterize plant responses to AM fungi and aphids and (ii) assess whether soil AM fungi could influence the success of the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi when attacking aphids reared on each Solanum type. In both experiments, similar patterns of plant biomass were observed in relation to AM fungal and aphid treatments. Solanum biomass depended on plant type and aphid infection with H. defensa. Plants exposed to aphids harbouring H. defensa had smaller root biomass, and therefore total plant biomass, compared to plants infested with H. defensa-free aphids. M. euphorbiae performance varied with aphid clonal line, Solanum type and the presence of AM fungi. Parasitoid success, measured as the proportion of aphids from which a wasp emerged, was highest from aphids that had fed on plants colonized by AM fungi, although this result also varied with Solanum type and aphid clonal line. Synthesis. The presence of soil AM fungi, combined with within-species plant and insect variation in key traits, can have subtle – but significant – effects on plant fitness and insect success. This study highlights the importance of exploring genotypic variation in plant and pest responses to soil microbiota to identify suitable biocontrol options.},

abstract = {Urbanization and habitat fragmentation are major threats to wildlife populations, especially mammalian carnivores. We studied the ecology and behavior of bobcats ( Lynx rufus ) and coyotes ( Canis latrans ) relative to development in a fragmented landscape in southern California from 1996 to 2000. We captured and radiocollared 50 bobcats and 86 coyotes, determined home ranges for 35 bobcats and 40 coyotes, and measured their exposure to development ( “urban association” ) as the percentage of each home range composed of developed or modified areas. Both species occupied predominantly natural home ranges. Adult female bobcats had low levels of urban association, significantly lower than coyotes, adult male bobcats, and young female bobcats. Home-range size was positively correlated with urban association for coyotes and adult male and young female bobcats, suggesting that human-dominated areas were less suitable than natural areas in some important way. Animals more associated with non-natural areas had higher levels of night activity, and both bobcats and coyotes were more likely to be in developed areas at night than during the day. Survival rates were relatively high and were not related to urban association, at least for animals  6–9 months of age. Mortality rates from human-related causes such as vehicle collisions and incidental poisoning were also independent of urban association. In this region, even the few animals that had almost no human development within their home range were vulnerable to human-related mortality. Carnivore conservation in urban landscapes must account for these mortality sources that influence the entire landscape, including reserves. For bobcats, preserving open space of sufficient quantity and quality for adult females is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about carnivores is also critical for conserving populations in urban areas.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was to study the influence of the presence of plants and of plant species on the treatment efficiency of shallow (0.3 m effective depth) horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (CWs) treating diluted municipal wastewater. The pilot plant was situated in A Coru{\~{n}}a (Spain) and constituted of five CW units in parallel: CW1 (unplanted), CW2 (Juncus effusus) CW3 (Iris pseudacorus), CW4 (Typha latifolia L.) and CW5 (Phragmites australis). A long term study (from October 2009 to March 2012) was carried out with five monitoring campaigns during the two first years of operation at low surface loading rate (SLR, 2.5 g BOD5/m2d on average) and two monitoring campaigns during the third year at design SLR (4.7 g BOD5/m2d on average). At low SLR rate, significant differences between units were not found for TSS (89-93{\%}), COD (83-88{\%}) or BOD5(90-95{\%}) percentage removal which, in turn, appeared at design SLR, when BOD5removal decreased to 78{\%} (CW1), 69{\%} (CW4), 87{\%} (CW2), 86{\%} (CW3) and 94{\%} (CW5). Thus, the effect of plants on the removal efficiency of organic matter (COD, BOD5) appeared to be dependent on the loading rate. CW2 reached the highest nitrogen removal, followed by CW4, CW5 and CW3 at a similar level and, finally, by CW1. Results indicate that the additional nitrogen removal rate in planted units increased with plant biomass productivity which also determined evapotranspiration variability between units. Typha latifolia L. appeared to be the most sensitive species to adverse conditions.},

abstract = {Stressful environments may enhance the occurrence of facilitative interspecific interactions between plants. In several regions, Zostera marina occurs in mixed assemblages. However, the potential effects of plant diversity on stress responses and stability properties of Z. marina are poorly understood. We investigated the resistance and recovery of Z. marina subjected to shading (1 mo) in a field experiment lasting 2.5 mo. We shaded Z. marina planted in mono- and polycultures (Potamogeton perfoliatus, P. pectinatus, P. filiformis) in a factorial design (Shading×Richness) at 2 m depth. We estimated the resistance and recovery of Z. marina by measuring four response variables. Polyculture Z. marina lost proportionally less biomass than monocultures, thus having a greater resistance to shading. In contrast, after a 1 mo recovery period, monocultures exhibited higher biomass gain, and a faster recovery than polycultures. Our results suggest that plant species richness enhances the resistance of Z. marina through facilitative mechanisms, while the faster recovery in monocultures is possibly due to interspecific competition. Our results highlight the need of a much better understanding of the effects of interspecific interactions on ecosystem processes in mixed seagrass meadows, and the preservation of diverse plant assemblages to maintain ecosystem functioning.},

However, to what extent the effects of plant diversity on the arthropod community on a focal plant are mediated by host plant quality or by the diversity of the surrounding plants remains unresolved. 2. In the field, we sampled arthropod communities on focal Jacobaea vulgaris plants growing in experimental plant communities that were maintained at different levels of diversity (one, two, four or nine species) for 3 years. Focal plants were also planted in plots without surrounding vegetation. We recorded the structural characteristics of each of the surrounding plant communities as well as the growth, and primary and secondary chemistry (pyrrolizidine alkaloids, PAs) of the focal plants to disentangle the potential mechanisms causing the diversity effects. 3. Two years after planting, the abundance of arthropods on focal plants that were still in the vegetative stage decreased with increasing plant diversity, while the abundance of arthropods on reproductive focal plants was not significantly affected by the diversity of the neighbouring community. The size of both vegetative and reproductive focal plants was not significantly affected by the diversity of the neighbouring community, but the levels of PAs and the foliar N concentration of vegetative focal plants decreased with increasing plant diversity. Structural equation modelling revealed that the effects of plant diversity on the arthropod communities on focal plants were not mediated by changes in plant quality. 4. Synthesis. Plant quality can greatly influence insect preference and performance. However, under natural conditions, the effects of the neighbouring plant community can overrule the plant quality effects of individual plants growing in those communities on the abundance of insects associated to this plant.},

abstract = {While the positive role of macrophytes on removal efficiency in constructed wetlands has been well established, possible differences in performance between plants species of comparable life forms and sizes are much harder to demonstrate. We reviewed 35 experimental studies published in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings on the effect of macrophyte species selection on pollutant removal in SSFCW. The studies cover a wide range of macrophyte species, experimental approaches (from well-replicated microcosm experiments to comparison between full full-size constructed wetlands), climatic conditions (from tropical to cold-temperate) and types of effluent (domestic, industrial, etc.). Frequent methodological limitations in these studies compel caution in the interpretation of their results. Yet, the fact that the majority found some (occasionally large) differences in efficiency between plant species for one or more type of pollutant suggests that macrophyte species selection does matter. However, there is little generalization to be made that could help guide species selection for SSFCW, except for the exact conditions in which the experiments were done. For example, the same pair of species that was tested in different studies occasionally gave opposite results in terms of which one performs best. Also, most studies provided few insights on the mechanisms or plant properties that could explain the observed differences in plant species efficiency. Finally, we discuss other relevant research questions and approaches that could help better guide macrophyte species selection for CW. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The site was located in southwest Michigan, representative of rain-fed production, with high climate variability and well-drained soils. Provisioning services of grain and protein yield were monitored, simultaneous with supporting services of soil fertility, C and N, and regulating services associated with water quality (N-use efficiency and nitrate-N leached in gravimetric lysimeters). Surprisingly, a strong role for management was shown, and almost nil for crop diversity. Organic management (ORG) sustained soil fertility, augmented soil C (36{\%} increase), enhanced N retention (50{\%} decrease in nitrate-N leaching) and improved N-use efficiency, compared to conventional, integrated (INT) management. Provisioning of grain - quantity, quality and temporal yield stability - was highest in INT continuous maize (monoculture and biculture) with an annual yield of 6.4Mgha-1, compared to ORG of 5.1Mgha-1. Biodiverse rotational systems (three and six species) produced 25{\%} lower yield, but the grain was of high quality.

abstract = {Complementary resource use has often been claimed to explain positive effects of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning, but the underlying mechanisms of complementarity have rarely been directly quantified in forest systems. The aim of this study was to characterize spatial and temporal water uptake of subtropical tree saplings, to assess the role of interspecific interaction on water uptake patterns and to quantify species niche breadth and overlap. Our experiment comprised two deciduous (Castanea henryi, Quercus serrata) and two evergreen tree species (Elaeocarpus decipiens, Schima superba) that were each planted in monoculture and 4-species mixture. We used deuterium-enriched water to trace seasonal water uptake from 5 cm and 20 cm soil depth. Castanea exploited predominantly the upper soil (74{\%} of overall tracer uptake across treatments) whereas Quercus (50{\%}), Elaeocarpus (57{\%}) and Schima (62{\%}) tended to use both soil layers more equally. Species identity had an overall significant effect on isotopic enrichment in stem water. There was no effect of species richness: niche breadth and overlap of single species was not affected by interspecific interactions in mixtures. Niche overlap between deciduous species was lowest (74{\%}) whereas the two evergreen species had similar water uptake patterns (91{\%}). According to our results, interspecific competition did not alter water uptake patterns of the studied species during the early phase of forest establishment. Thus, soil water uptake complementarity could only occur through inherent (fundamental) specific differences in water uptake niches based on sapling specialization, while phenotypic adjustments to interspecific interaction or neighbor diversity are less important.},

abstract = {* Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio. * However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. * In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. * Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and lnx¯ (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with lnx¯ overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. * Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

- recently, more focus on variance rather than the mean (i.e. intraspecific variation)
- experiment + treatments should affect both mean and variance

- New measures for meta-analysis
- lnVR: limited bc of mean-variance (eqn 9)
- lnCVR: indepedent of mean-variance (eqn 11)
- both have sampling variance (eqn 10, 12)

- limitations of lnCVR
- limited only to ratio scale data
- assumes linearity btw mean and SD

- but, ecol/evol datasets may follow a power law
- solution: use REMA/multilevel based on the logarithm of power law
- can incorporate phylo nonindependence
- cons: complex, can't use other validation plots

- proposed measures are useful if effects induce change on both mean and variability},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine preservice elementary school teachers' geometry learning as investigated by both qualitative and quantitative methods. For the qualitative investigation, narrative analysis and thematic analysis methods were used. The findings of narrative analysis indicated two main kinds of stories: as a learner and as a beginning teacher. The thematic analysis findings yield to three themes: history of learning geometry, perceptions about geometry, effective geometry instructional practices. The findings informed the quantitative investigation on geometry content knowledge for the case of quadrilaterals. During the second phase of the study, 102 participants who enrolled in the methods course completed pre and post test of teachers' geometry content knowledge. Treatment group participants (n=54) received series of activities (geometry activities and student work analysis) focusing on quadrilaterals, and control group participants (n=48) received traditional instruction. Repeated measures ANOVA results showed a significant change in treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge. The mixed ANOVA results indicated a significant main effect of knowledge but no significant interaction between geometry content knowledge and grouping. Even though treatment group participants' geometry content knowledge growth was significant, the difference between treatment group and control group participants' growth in geometry content knowledge was not significant. This study informs mathematics teacher education in three important areas; limited knowledge of preservice teachers' geometry content knowledge, integrating mathematics content and the context of teaching into methods course, and use of student work with preservice teachers.},

abstract = {Following the arguments at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the Swedish legislation has been modified to pay special attention to sustainability, including the importance of green space in and around urban areas. The revised legislation stipulates that urban planning should promote a good state of living environment, biodiversity, efficient use of energy and other resources. According to the revised planning legislation, Swedish towns and cities are recommended to develop a green plan as an essential part of the mandatory structure plan. This plan is expected to identify urban green spaces and their value to the community in its efforts to attain sustainability and to preserve biodiversity. This paper attempts to answer the question whether green plans in Swedish cities take into consideration the multiple uses of green spaces in urban areas and considers their role in obtaining sustainable urban development. For this purpose, the criteria developed by the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning are used. With the help of these criteria, green plans from seven Swedish cities are evaluated. In addition to the Introduction, this paper consists of four sections. In the first section, the criteria used in the evaluation of the green plans are defined. In the following sections, the seven green plans are evaluated and the results of the evaluation are elaborated upon. The quantitative evaluation is presented in the Appendix. Finally, the role of urban green space is discussed in a broad planning perspective.},

@article{WOS406,
abstract = {Several studies have shown that the contribution of individual species to the positive relationship between species richness and community biomass production cannot be easily predicted from species monocultures. Here, we used a biodiversity experiment with a pool of nine potentially dominant grassland species to relate the species richness-productivity relationship to responses in density, size and aboveground allocation patterns of individual species. Aboveground community biomass increased strongly with the transition from monocultures to two-species mixtures but only slightly with the transition from two- to nine-species mixtures. Tripartite partitioning showed that the strong increase shown by the former was due to trait-independent complementarity effects, while the slight increase shown by the latter was due to dominance effects. Trait-dependent complementarity effects depended on species composition. Relative yield total (RYT) was greater than 1 (RYT{\textgreater}1) in mixtures but did not increase with species richness, which is consistent with the constant complementarity effect. The relative yield (RY) of only one species, Arrhenatherum elatius, continually increased with species richness, while those of the other species studied decreased with species richness or varied among different species compositions within richness levels. High observed/expected RYs (RYo/RYe{\textgreater}1) of individual species were mainly due to increased module densities, whereas low observed/expected RYs (RYo/RYe{\textless}1) were due to more pronounced decreases in module density (species with stoloniferous or creeping growth) or module size (species with clearly-defined plant individuals). The trade-off between module density and size, typical for plant populations under the law of constant final yield, was compensated among species. The positive trait-independent complementarity effect could be explained by an increase in community module density, which reached a maximum at low species richness. In contrast, the increasing dominance effect was attributable to the species-specific ability, in particular that of A. elatius, to increase module size, while intrinsic growth limitations led to a suppression of the remaining species in many mixtures.},

abstract = {Intensive farming focusing on monoculture grass species to maximise forage production has led to a reduction in the extent and diversity of species-rich grasslands. However, plant communities with higher species number (richness) are a potential strategy for more sustainable production and mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Research has indicated the need to understand opportunities that forage mixtures can offer sustainable ruminant production systems. The objective of the two experiments reported here were to evaluate multiple species forage mixtures in comparison to ryegrass-dominant pasture, when conserved or grazed, on digestion, energy utilisation, N excretion, and methane emissions by growing 10-15 month old heifers. Experiment 1 was a 4×4 Latin square design with five week periods. Four forage treatments of: (1) ryegrass (control); permanent pasture with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne); (2) clover; a ryegrass:red clover (Trifolium pratense) mixture; (3) trefoil; a ryegrass:birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) mixture; and (4) flowers; a ryegrass:wild flower mixture of predominately sorrel (Rumex acetosa), ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), were fed as haylages to four dairy heifers. Measurements included digestibility, N excretion, and energy utilisation (including methane emissions measured in respiration chambers). Experiment 2 used 12 different dairy heifers grazing three of the same forage treatments used to make haylage in experiment 1 (ryegrass, clover and flowers) and methane emissions were estimated using the sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique. Distribution of ryegrass to other species (dry matter (DM) basis) was approximately 70:30 (clover), 80:20 (trefoil), and 40:60 (flowers) for experiment 1. During the first and second grazing rotations (respectively) in experiment 2, perennial ryegrass accounted for 95 and 98{\%} of DM in ryegrass, and 84 and 52{\%} of DM in clover, with red clover accounting for almost all of the remainder. In the flowers mixture, perennial ryegrass was 52{\%} of the DM in the first grazing rotation and only 30{\%} in the second, with a variety of other flower species occupying the remainder. Across both experiments, compared to the forage mixtures (clover, trefoil and flowers), ryegrass had a higher crude protein (CP) content (P{\textless}0.001, 187 vs. 115gkg -1 DM) and DM intake (P{\textless}0.05, 9.0 vs. 8.1kgday -1). Heifers in experiment 1 fed ryegrass, compared to the forage mixtures, had greater total tract digestibility (gkg -1) of DM (DMD; P{\textless}0.008, 713 vs. 641) and CP (CPD, P{\textless}0.001, 699 vs. 475), and used more intake energy ({\%}) for body tissue deposition (P{\textless}0.05, 2.6 vs. -4.9). For both experiments, heifers fed flowers differed the most compared to the ryegrass control for a number of measurements. Compared to ryegrass, flowers had 40{\%} lower CP content (P{\textless}0.001, 113 vs. 187gkg -1), 18{\%} lower DMD (P{\textless}0.01, 585 vs. 713gkg -1), 42{\%} lower CPD (P{\textless}0.001, 407 vs. 699gkg -1), and 10{\%} lower methane yield (P{\textless}0.05, 22.6 vs. 25.1gkg -1 DM intake). This study has shown inclusion of flowers in forage mixtures resulted in a lower CP concentration, digestibility and intake. These differences were due in part to sward management and maturity at harvest. Further research is needed to determine how best to exploit the potential environmental benefits of forage mixtures in sustainable ruminant production systems.},

abstract = {The larger aquatic plants growing in wetlands are usually called macrophytes. These include aquatic vascular plants, aquatic mosses and some larger algae. The presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes is one of the characteristics used to define wetlands, and as such macrophytes are an indispensable component of these ecosystems. As the most important removal processes in constructed treatment wetlands are based on physical and microbial processes, the role of the macrophytes in these has been questioned. This paper summarizes how macrophytes influence the treatment processes in wetlands. The most important functions of the macrophytes in relation to the treatment of wastewater are the physical effects the presence of the plants gives rise to. The macrophytes stabilise the surface of the beds, provide good conditions for physical filtration, prevent vertical flow systems from clogging, insulate the surface against frost during winter, and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth. Contrary to earlier belief, the growth of macrophytes does not increase the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate in soil-based subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The metabolism of the macrophytes affects the treatment processes to different extents depending on the type of the constructed wetland. Plant uptake of nutrients is only of quantitative importance in low-loaded systems (surface flow systems). Macrophyte mediated transfer of oxygen to the rhizosphere by leakage from roots increases aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitrification. The macrophytes have additional site-specific values by providing habitat for wildlife and making wastewater treatment systems aesthetically pleasing. (C) 1997 IAWQ},

abstract = {Limited information is available on the dry matter production, protein content and species composition of complex mixtures of introduced perennial forage crop species for hay and pasture in the moister regions of Saskatchewan. A field experiment was sown on 2008 May 27 at Melfort, Saskatchewan, Canada, on a thick Black Chernozem (Udic Boroll) silty clay soil, to compare the effects on dry matter yield (DMY), protein content and species composition of perennial forage crop monocultures and mixtures, under a twocut and a three-cut management system, in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Eleven treatments consisted of monocultures of hybrid bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.×Bromus inermis Leyss.), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn], intermediate wheatgrass [Agropyron intermedium (Host.) Beauv.] and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.); simple mixtures of each of these individual grass species with alfalfa; a more complex mixture of all these grass species and alfalfa, and a very complex mixture consisting of the complex mixture plus meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) Wimm.], timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and slender wheatgrass [Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould ex Shinners]. The alfalfa was inoculated with rhizobium, and no fertilizer was added to any treatment during the course of the study. The two-cut system yielded higher than the three-cut system in all years. In 2009, the first cutting year, all treatments, especially under the two-cut system, produced similar forage DMY, with monoculture grasses yielding as much as that of their mixture with alfalfa. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, however, monoculture alfalfa and grass-alfalfa treatments had higher DMY than the monoculture grasses. Monoculture alfalfa also showed superior DMY than most grass-alfalfa mixtures, especially during the last 2 yr of the study. In conclusion, the inclusion of alfalfa in forage mixtures, grown in unfertilized soil, significantly increased forage yield, especially after the first production year, and these grass-alfalfa mixtures yielded almost as much as monoculture alfalfa. Also, the inclusion of alfalfa significantly increased the forage protein content over the grass alone treatments. Hybrid bromegrass, grown alone or in mixture with alfalfa, yielded similar to the other grasses tested, while crested wheatgrass did not compete as well as other main grasses, grown alone or in mixture with alfalfa. In this study, the use of complex or very complex mixtures of introduced grasses with alfalfa did not increase DMY over the simple grass-alfalfa mixtures.},

abstract = {Green roofs are increasingly being considered a promising engineered ecosystem for reducing stormwater runoff. Plants are a critical component of green roofs and it has been suggested that plants with high water use after rainfall, but which are also drought tolerant, can improve rainfall retention on green roofs. However, there is little evidence to show how plants with different water use strategies will affect green roof retention performance, either in monocultures or in mixed plantings. This study tested how monocultures and a mixture of herbaceous species (Dianella admixta, Lomandra longifolia and Stypandra glauca) affected rainfall retention on green roofs. These species were chosen based on their water use strategies and compared with a commonly used succulent species (Sedum pachyphyllum) with conservative water use. We measured retention performance for 67 rainfall events, quantifying all components of the water balance. We also compared growth for species in monocultures and mixtures. We found that monocultures of L. longifolia had the greatest stormwater retention and ET. Although S. glauca has a similar water use strategy to D. admixta, it had the lowest stormwater retention and ET. In both the mixture and as a monoculture, S. glauca created preferential flow pathways, resulting in lower substrate water contents which reduced ET and therefore rainfall retention. This species also dominated performance of the mixture, such that the mixture had lower ET and retention than all monocultures (except S. glauca). We suggest that root traits and their interaction with substrates should be considered alongside water use strategies for rainfall retention on green roofs.},

Yet few studies have examined whether the strength of these interactions corresponds with the abundance of plant species in the field, or whether feedbacks and competition interact in ways that either ameliorate or exacerbate their effects in isolation. We sampled soil from two intermountain grassland communities where we also measured the relative abundance of plant species. In greenhouse experiments, we quantified the direction and magnitude of plant-soil feedbacks for 10 target species that spanned a range of abundances in the field. In soil from both sites, plant-soil feedbacks were mostly negative, with more abundant species suffering greater negative feed-backs than rare species. In contrast, the average response to competition for each species was unrelated with its abundance in the field. We also determined how competitive response varied among our target species when plants competed in live vs. sterile soil. Interspecific competition reduced plant size, but the strength of this negative effect was unchanged by plant-soil feedbacks. Finally, when plants competed interspecifically, we asked how conspecific-trained, heterospecific-trained, and sterile soil influenced the competitive responses of our target species and how this varied depending on whether target species were abundant or rare in the field. Here, we found that both abundant and rare species were not as harmed by competition when they grew in heterospecific-trained soil compared to when they grew in conspecific-cultured soil. Abundant species were also not as harmed by competition when growing in sterile vs. conspecific-trained soil, but this was not the case for rare species. Our results suggest that abundant plants accrue species-specific soil pathogens to a greater extent than rare species. Thus, negative feedbacks may be critical for preventing abundant species from becoming even more abundant than rare species.},

abstract = {Grassland productivity can be estimated using individual-centred models or via crop simulators parameterized to mimic average morphological and physiological features of the phytocoenosis as a whole. Although the latter is often considered an oversimplified solution, individual-centred models are characterized by a degree of complexity that often restricts their use to scientists specialized in pastures modelling or in crop-weed interaction. In this study, an intermediate solution is presented (CoSMo), based on two assumptions allowing the use of a single instance of a generic crop model to simulate phytocoenosis dynamics and productivity. The first is that community parameters can be derived at each time step from the relative presence of the different species and from parameter values determined for the species in monoculture. The second is that inter-specific competition and changes in species relative presence can be simulated as a function of species-specific responses to hierarchically arranged drivers (triggered and continuous) representing the suitability of the different species to the conditions explored at each time step. CoSMo was here analyzed by means of three simulation experiments, where changes in the relative presence of three species with different traits and the productivity of the community were simulated under current conditions and future climate projections. Results encourage further studies, given that the solution proposed is easy to implement and parameterize, and leaves users free to work with the generic crop simulator they are familiar with. These features make CoSMo suitable for being coupled - within integrated studies - to models developed for other domains by scientists not specialist in the ecophysiological aspects involved with inter-specific competition. However, this approach cannot be considered as an alternative to individual-centred models in case of in silico studies explicitly focusing on the relationships between inter-specific competition and species traits and phenotypic plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding plant reproduction from an eco-phylogenetic perspective is essential because it allows us to predict how phenology could change in response to climatic changes. Unfortunately, reproductive patterns have been poorly explored in contemporary phylogenetic context until now. Closely related species are expected to reproduce in a similar ecological niche if phylogeny constrains the time of flowering and fruiting. In contrast, if climate determines phenology regardless of species affinities, species would randomly reproduce along favourable temporal axes. In this study, we used a clade of Neotropical Myrtaceae to test the influence of phylogenetic signal (PS) in phenology. Myrtaceae is the eighth largest angiosperm plant family in the world and the most speciose in the Atlantic rainforest. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among 57 Myrteae species plus an outgroup and quantified PS across three Atlantic rainforest communities: Saibadela, Cardoso and Picinguaba. Ecological factors were the main drivers of plant phenology. However, PS in plant reproduction was detected for flowering in Cardoso, suggesting a clade-specific response because flowering was conservative in the Gomidesia group. Fruiting in Saibadela also exhibited PS with phenological divergence between taxa with similar embryo shape and conservative fruiting time inside these groups, indicating that seed germination requirement can affect fruiting phenology. We suggest that investigation of PS in phenology should consider phylogenetic non-stationarity because evolutionary rates and ecological patterns are variable across taxa and often variable in short time scales. The identification of clades with conservative phenology, indicates the taxa most sensitive to climate change that can guide future conservation initiatives.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that stability should increase with diversity via several mechanisms. We tested predictions in a 5-year experiment that compared low-diversity exotic to high-diversity native plant mixtures under two irrigation treatments. The study included both wet and dry years. Variation in biomass across years (CV) was 50{\%} lower in mixtures than monocultures of both native and exotic species. Growth among species was more asynchronous and overyielding values were greater during and after a drought in native than exotic mixtures. Mean-variance slopes indicated strong portfolio effects in both community types, but the intercept was higher for exotics than for natives, suggesting that exotics were inherently more variable than native species. However, this failed to result in higher CV's in exotic communities because species that heavily dominated plots tended to have lower than expected variance. Results indicate that diversity-stability mechanisms are altered in invaded systems compared to native ones they replaced.},

abstract = {A key challenge in research linking biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is to incorporate the trophic interactions that characterise natural systems. There is a particular shortage of studies investigating consumer species richness and composition (identity) effects in the context of ecosystem development (or succession). We manipulated the richness and composition of an assemblage of molluscan grazers (Patella ulyssiponensis, Gibbula umbilicalis and Littorina littorea) added to rock pools denuded of existing biota. We created monocultures and all possible multispecies combinations in a substitutive design, and ran a field experiment for 13 mo. We used 2 separate nested analyses to isolate the roles of species richness, species composition nested within levels of species richness and the specific effect of the limpet P. ulyssiponensis, a putative key species. We found no evidence that the biomass or productivity of the developing macroalgal assemblage was affected by grazer richness or species composition nested within richness levels. Rather, the presence of P. ulyssiponensis, irrespective of the presence of other grazer species, acted to suppress mean values of these response variables. Biomass and productivity were not strongly related, showing that they provide unique information on ecosystem functioning in this system. Macroalgal species richness was also reduced by P. ulyssiponensis, and correlated positively with macroalgal biomass, indicating a link between these response variables. Macroalgal species composition was largely insensitive to either species richness or the presence of P. ulyssiponensis, but responded to particular combinations of species within levels of these factors. The key role of P. ulyssiponensis in determining ecosystem functioning is apparent from our results, but we note that consumer species richness may play an important role under more heterogeneous conditions.},

abstract = {1. Positive effects of biodiversity on plant productivity may result from diversity-induced changes in the size or density of individual plants, yet these two possibilities have never been tested at the same time in a biodiversity experiment with a large species pool. Here, we distinguish between size effects and density effects on plant productivity, using data from 198 experimental grassland communities that contained 1–16 species. Plant modules such as tillers or rosettes were defined as relevant units, being equivalent to plant individuals in the majority of species. 2. In agreement with previous studies, we found positive effects of species richness on above-ground productivity. We show that this positive biodiversity effect resulted from diversity-induced increases in module density rather than from increases in module size. In contrast, variation in productivity within diversity levels was related to module size rather than module density. 3. The size–density relationships varied among plant functional groups and among species but their average response to increasing species richness paralleled the pattern observed at the level of the entire plant communities: species richness had a positive effect on above-ground species biomass and species module density but not on species module size. Twenty-four out of 26 overyielding species had denser populations and 25 out of 28 underyielding species had smaller modules in mixtures than in monocultures. 4. Synthesis . In grasslands, an increase in community productivity must involve an increase in plant size or density. We found that diversity-induced increases in productivity were related to diversity- induced increases in density, whereas diversity-independent increases in productivity were related to increases in plant size. Our results suggest that increased density of overyielding species in mixtures was the main driver of the positive biodiversity–productivity relationship in our experiment. We conclude that the mechanisms leading to enhanced productivity of species-rich as compared with species-poor communities cannot be derived from mechanisms explaining high productivity within communities that contain a particular number of species.},

We conducted two infiltration measurement campaigns (May and October 2012) using a hood infiltrometer. Results Plant species richness significantly increased infiltration capacity in the studied grasslands. Both soil porosity (or inversely bulk density) and organic carbon played an important role in mediating the plant species richness effect. Soil texture did not correlate with infiltration capacity. In spring 2012, earthworm biomass increased infiltration capacity, but this effect could not be attributed to changes in soil structural variables. Conclusions We experimentally identified important ecological drivers of infiltration capacity, suggesting complex interactions between plant species richness, earthworms, and soil structural variables, while showing little impact of soil texture. Changes in plant species richness may thus have significant effects on soil hydraulic properties with potential consequences for surface run-off and soil erosion.},

Thus, understanding phenotypic attributes that allow species to partition resources is fundamentally important to explaining diversity-productivity relationships.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we use data from a long-term experiment (Cedar Creek, MN) and compare the extent to which productivity is explained by seven types of community metrics of functional variation: 1) species richness, 2) variation in 10 individual traits, 3) functional group richness, 4) a distance-based measure of functional diversity, 5) a hierarchical multivariate clustering method, 6) a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach, and 7) a phylogenetic diversity measure, summing phylogenetic branch lengths connecting community members together and may be a surrogate for ecological differences. Although most of these diversity measures provided significant explanations of variation in productivity, the presence of a nitrogen fixer and phylogenetic diversity were the two best explanatory variables. Further, a statistical model that included the presence of a nitrogen fixer, seed weight and phylogenetic diversity was a better explanation of community productivity than other models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Evolutionary relationships among species appear to explain patterns of grassland productivity. Further, these results reveal that functional differences among species involve a complex suite of traits and that perhaps phylogenetic relationships provide a better measure of the diversity among species that contributes to productivity than individual or small groups of traits.},

abstract = {Climate warming and plant species richness loss have been the subject of numerous experiments, but studies on their combined im- pact are lacking. Here we studied how both warming and species richness loss affect water use in grasslands, while identifying interactions be- tween these global changes. Experimental eco- systems containing one, three or nine grassland species from three functional groups were grown in 12 sunlit, climate-controlled chambers (2.25 m2 ground area) in Wilrijk, Belgium. Half of these chambers were exposed to ambient air temperatures (unheated), while the other half were warmed by 3?C (heated). Equal amounts of water were added to heated and unheated communities, so that warming would imply drier soils if evapotranspiration (ET) was higher. After an initial ET increase in response to warming, stomatal regulation and lower above-ground productivity resulted in ET values comparable with those recorded in the unheated communities. As a result of the decreased biomass production, water use efficiency (WUE) was reduced by warming. Higher complementarity and the im- proved competitive success of water-efficient species in mixtures led to an increased WUE in multi-species communities as compared to monocultures, regardless of the induced warming. However, since the WUE of individual species was affected in different ways by higher temper- atures, compositional changes in mixtures seem likely under climatic change due to shifts in competitiveness. In conclusion, while increased complementarity and selection of water-efficient species ensured more efficient water use in mix- tures than monocultures, global warming will likely decrease this WUE, and this may be most pronounced in species-rich communities.},

abstract = {A long standing ecological paradigm suggests that diverse plant communities should be more resistant to weed invasion compared with plant communities that have few species. Data from three separate studies were used to test the hypothesis that increased forage species diversity reduces weed invasion in pasture communities. The first study measured weed invasion in experimentally constructed pasture communities containing 1-15 species. A second experiment conducted in the greenhouse involved sowing a common perennial weed species, curly dock (Rumex crispus), into forage mixtures with 5 or 10 different forage species and three monocultures. The third study investigated the relationship between weed abundance and forage diversity in 37 pastures surveyed across the northeastern United States. Consistent negative relationships between forage species diversity and weed abundance were found. The causal mechanisms explaining the negative relationships between forage diversity and weed invasion were difficult to delineate since diversity was often correlated with highly productive pasture communities. The results suggest that maintaining both productive pasture communities ({\textgreater} 150 g m-2of aboveground biomass) and an evenly distributed array of forage species should be combined to effectively reduce weed invasion. Managing pastures for increased forage species diversity could be a useful cultural control method for weeds. Increasing the diversity of forage plants also has other ecosystem benefits to pasture communities (e.g., greater primary production, stability) beyond that of weed suppression. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Pollinators play a key role in the reproduction of most plant species, and pollinator and plant diversity are often related. We studied an experimental gradient of plant species richness for a better understanding of plant-pollinator community interactions and their temporal variability, because in non-experimental field surveys plant richness is often confounded with gradients in management, soil fertility, and community composition. We observed pollinator species richness and frequency of visits six times in 73 plots over two years, and used advanced statistical analysis to account for the high number of zeroes that often occur in count data of rare species. The frequency of pollinator visits increased linearly with both the blossom cover and the number of flowering plant species, which was closely related to the total number of plant species, whereas the number of pollinator species followed a saturation curve. The presence of particularly attractive plant species was only important for the frequency of flower visits, but not to the richness of pollinators. Plant species richness, blossom cover, and the presence of attractive plant species enhanced the temporal stability in the frequency of pollinator visits.

abstract = {Aims In grassland biodiversity experiments, positive biodiversity effects on primary productivity increase over time. Recent research has shown that differential selection in monoculture and mixed-species communities leads to the rapid emergence of monoculture and mixture types, adapted to their own biotic community. We used eight plant species selected for 8 years in such a biodiversity experiment to test if monoculture and mixture types differed in metabolic profiles using infrared spectroscopy.Methods Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to assess metabolic fingerprints of leaf samples of 10 individuals of each species from either monocultures or mixtures. The FTIR spectra were analyzed using multivariate procedures to assess (i) whether individuals within species could be correctly assigned to monoculture or mixture history based on the spectra alone and (ii) which parts of the spectra drive the group assignment, i.e. which metabolic groups were subject to differential selection in monocultures vs. mixtures.Important Findings Plant individuals within each of the eight species could be classified as either from monoculture or mixture selection history based on their FTIR spectra. Different metabolic groups were differentially selected in the different species; some of them may be related to defense of pathogens accumulating more strongly in monocultures than in mixtures. The rapid selection of the monoculture and mixture types within the eight study species could have been due to a sorting-out process based on large initial genetic or epigenetic variation within the species.},

abstract = {Background and aims Mixing grasses with N2-fixing legumes benefits grassland yields. We examined if grass/forb/legume mixtures combining species with complementary vertical and temporal nutrient capture further promote nutrient yields and improve fertilizer N recovery. Methods Four species differing in N2-fixing ability and in vertical and temporal nutrient capture were grown in monoculture and two- and four-species mixtures. 15N was used to examine vertical complementarity in nutrient capture and fertilizer N recovery. Asynchrony was quan- tified from the N yield distribution over the year. Results The positive mixture effects on N and P yields (P {\textless} 0.001) between species contrasting in vertical and temporal nutrient capture (with same N2-fixing ability) were of a similar magnitude (+45 kg N) as those be- tween N2-fixing and non-fixing species with shallow roots (+52 kg N). Mixture benefits were maximized up to +99 kg N when constituent species differed in N2- fixing ability and vertical and temporal nutrient capture. Speciesmodified their verticalNcapture when grown in mixture (niche shift). Remarkably, mixing Trifolium pratense and Cichorium intybus, which were similar in both vertical and temporal nutrient capture, generated negative mixture effects. The 4-species mixture cap- tured as much fertilizer N as the grass monoculture, despite significant abundance of legumes. Conclusions Combining species differing in multiple characteristics for nutrient capture optimizes nutrient capture of non-legume/legume-mixtures.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) and leaf morphology were assessed in two sites in Europe (Kaltenborn, Germany, and Satakunta, Finland) within a forest diversity experiment. Trees at Satakunta, planted in 1999, form a stratified canopy, while in Kaltenborn the trees are 7 years old, with no apparent canopy connection among broadleaf species. The following ChlF parameters from measured OJIP transient curves were examined: F(V)/F(M) (a proxy for maximum quantum yield); $\Psi$Eo (a proxy for efficiency in transferring an electron from reduced QA to the electron transport chain); I-P phase (a proxy for efficiency of reducing final acceptors beyond PSI); and PItot (total performance index for potential energy conservation from photons absorbed by PSII to reduction of PSI end acceptors). At Satakunta F(V)/F(M) and $\Psi$Eo in Betula pendula were higher in monocultures and lower in mixed plots, perhaps due to increasing light availability in mixed plots, which can induce photoinhibition. The opposite trend was observed in Picea abies, which was shaded in mixed plots. At Kaltenborn F(V)/F(M) decreased in Fagus sylvatica and P. abies in mixed plots due to competition both above- and belowground. At Satakunta LMA increased in B. pendula leaves with increasing species richness. Leaf area of ten leaves was reduced in F. sylvatica in mixed plots at Kaltenborn. By up-scaling the overall fluorescence response to plot level (PItot{\_}plot ), a significant positive correlation with tree diversity was found at Kaltenborn, but not at Satakunta. This could suggest that competition/facilitation processes in mixed stands play a significant role in the early stages of forest establishment, but then tend to be compensated in more mature stands.},

abstract = {Aim Positive relationships between plant species diversity and above-ground productivity have been observed across a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite a critical contribution of below-ground productivity to overall terrestrial productivity, no consensus exists about the nature of the relationship between species diversity and below-ground productivity. Location Global. Methods We collected data from published studies conducted in natural and planted forests and experimental grassland, crop and pot systems that were purposely implemented to isolate the effects of plant species diversity from other factors, such as soil conditions and topographic features. We conducted meta-analyses of 170 observations for root biomass and 23 observations for root production, derived from 48 published studies, using weighted linear modelling with bootstrap procedures to reconcile the effects of diversity on fine root productivity. Results We found that species mixtures had, on average 28.4{\%} higher fine root biomass and 44.8{\%} higher annual production than monocultures. Higher fine root biomass in species mixtures than in monocultures was consistent across natural forests, planted grasslands, croplands and pot systems, except for young planted forests. Transgressive overyielding was only evident for planted grasslands. The log response ratio of fine root biomass in species mixtures to that in respective monocultures increased with species richness across all ecosystem types, and also increased with experiment age in grasslands. Main conclusions Our meta-analysis reveals positive effects of species diversity on below-ground productivity. Despite profound differences in environments among terrestrial ecosystems, our analysis demonstrated that below-ground productivity responds similarly to variations in species richness. Furthermore, our study also reveals shifts in the effects of diversity over time in both forests and grasslands. Future efforts are needed to further understand below-ground productivity–diversity relationships.},

abstract = {Context Converting monocultures to mixed-species stands is thought to be a promising approach to increase forest productivity and resilience, while additionally providing other ecosystem goods and services (EGS). However, the importance of tree species composition and structure remains unclear, particularly beyond the stand scale due to the difficulty of conducting comprehensive, long-term experiments.ObjectivesTo compare the ability of different tree species mixtures to provide various EGS at the landscape scale.MethodsWe used a dynamic forest landscape model to simulate all possible combinations of dominant tree species for two landscapes; a high-elevation alpine region (Dischma valley, Switzerland) and a lowland valley (Mt. Feldberg, Germany). We evaluated multiple EGS, including protection from gravitational hazards, aboveground biomass, and habitat quality, and examined trade-offs and synergies between them.ResultsMixed-species forests were usually better in providing multiple EGS, although monocultures were often best for single EGS. The simulation results also demonstrated how changing environmental conditions along an elevational gradient had a strong impact on the structure of different species combinations and therefore on the provisioning of EGS.ConclusionTree species diversity alone is not a good predictor of multifunctionality. Mixtures should be selected based on local environmental conditions, complementary functional traits, and the ability to provide the EGS of interest. Although our work focused on current climatic conditions, we discuss how the modelling framework could be employed to consider the impacts of climate change and disturbances to improve our understanding of how mixed-species stands could be used to cope with these challenges.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {This work aimed at determining the amount of energy that can be harvested by implementing microbial fuel cells (MFC) in horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) during the treatment of real domestic wastewater. To this aim, MFC were implemented in a pilot plant based on two HSSF CW, one fed with primary settled wastewater (Settler line) and the other fed with the effluent of a hydrolytic up-flow sludge blanket reactor (HUSB line). The eubacterial and archaeal community was profiled on wetland gravel, MFC electrodes and primary treated wastewater by means of 16S rRNA gene-based 454-pyrosequencing and qPCR of 16S rRNA and mcrA genes. Maximum current (219 mA/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and power (36 mW/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) densities were obtained for the HUSB line. Power production pattern correlated well with water level fluctuations within the wetlands, whereas the type of primary treatment implemented had a significant impact on the diversity and relative abundance of eubacteria communities colonizing MFC. It is worth noticing the high predominance (13-16{\%} of relative abundance) of one OTU belonging to Geobacter on active MFC of the HUSB line that was absent for the settler line MFC. Hence, MFC show promise for power production in constructed wetlands receiving the effluent of a HUSB reactor.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is expected to improve ecosystem services, e.g., productivity or seepage water quality. The current view of plant diversity effects on element cycling is based on short-term grassland studies that discount possibly slow belowground feedbacks to aboveground diversity. Furthermore, these grasslands were established on formerly arable land associated with changes in soil properties, e.g., accumulation of organic matter. We hypothesize that the plant diversity-N cycle relationship changes with time since establishment. We assessed the relationship between plant diversity and (1) aboveground and soil N storage and (2) NO3-N and NH4-N availability in soil between 2003 and 2007 in the Jena Experiment, a grassland experiment established in 2002 in which the number of plant species varied from 1 to 60. The positive effect of plant diversity on aboveground N storage (mainly driven by biomass production) tended to increase through time. The initially negative correlation between plant diversity and soil NO3-N availability disappeared after 2003. In 2006 and 2007, a positive correlation between plant diversity and soil NH4-N availability appeared which coincided with a positive correlation between plant diversity and N mineralized from total N accumulated in soil. We conclude that the plant diversity-N cycle relationship in newly established grasslands changes with time because of accumulation of organic matter in soil associated with the establishment. While a positive relationship between plant diversity and soil N storage improves soil fertility and reduces fertilizing needs, increasingly closed N cycling with increasing plant diversity as illustrated by decreased NO3-N concentrations in diverse mixtures reduces the negative impact of agricultural N leaching on groundwater resources.},

Here, we determined the rate of methane oxidation and flux, the abundance of methanogen 16S rRNA gene and methanotroph pmoA gene (encoding the $\alpha$-subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase), and the microbial diversity of methanogens and methanotrophs in the CW microcosm. The microcosms cultivated with a plant species richness level of 1 (monoculture) and 4 (mixture) species were fed with simulated wastewater with a high nitrogen concentration (336mgL-1). The results revealed a methane emission ranging from 0.101 to 0.476mg CH4m-2h-1in different systems; the planted systems achieved a higher methane flux rate than the unplanted systems. The highest CH4flux was detected in the mixture system. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the methanogen and methanotroph diversity revealed a relative stability of the microbial community structures, but the populations varied. Pearson analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between methanogenic and methanotrophic populations and potential methane oxidation activity and CH4flux, respectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the plant biomass exerted an important influence on both methanogenic and methanotrophic communities. The environmental conditions in the mixture systems supported a relatively higher abundance of methanogens and lowest abundance of methanotrophs, which might provide an explanation for the higher CH4emissions. Rumex japonicus performed better than other plant species in mediating nitrogen removal. The CH4flux of the monoculture system with Rumex japonicus did not differ from that of the mixture system. Thus, we hypothesize that Rumex japonicus may play an important role in mixed CWs, and its function in the mixture system necessitates further investigation.},

However, water manipulation and root measurements are rarely coupled empirically across growth forms to identify whether belowground strategies are generalizable across species. ? We measured seedling root traits across three moisture levels in 18 Mediterranean forbs, grasses, and woody species. ? Drought increased the root mass fraction (RMF) and decreased the relative proportion of thin roots (indicated by increased root diameters and decreased specific root length (SRL)), rates of root elongation and growth, plant nitrogen uptake, and plant growth. Although responses varied across species, plasticity was not associated with growth form. Woody species differed from forbs and grasses in many traits, but herbaceous groups were similar. Across water treatments, trait correlations suggested a single spectrum of belowground trade-offs related to resource acquisition and plant growth. While effects of SRL and RMF on plant growth shifted with drought, root elongation rate consistently represented this spec- trum. ? We demonstrate that general patterns of root morphology and plasticity are identifiable across diverse species. Root trait measurements should enhance our understanding of below- ground strategy and performance across growth forms, but it will be critical to incorporate plasticity and additional aspects of root function into these efforts.},

abstract = {Within-population genetic diversity influences many ecological processes, but few studies have examined how environmental conditions may impact these short-term diversity effects. Over four growing seasons, we followed experimental populations of a clonal, ubiquitous weed, Taraxacum officinale, with different numbers of genotypes in relatively favorable fallow field and unfavorable mowed lawn environmental treatments. Population performance (measured as total leaf area, seed production or biomass) clearly and consistently increased with diversity, and this effect became stronger over the course of the experiment. Diversity effects were stronger, and with different underlying mechanisms, in the fallow field versus the mowed lawn. Large genotypes dominated in the fallow field driving overyielding (via positive selection effects), whereas in the mowed lawn, where performance was limited by regular disturbance, there was evidence for complementarity among genotypes (with one compact genotype in particular performing better in mixture than monoculture). Hence, we predict stronger genotypic diversity effects in environments where intense intraspecific competition enhances genotypic differences. Our four-year field experiment plus seedling establishment trials indicate that genotypic diversity effects have far-reaching and context-dependent consequences across generations.},

abstract = {Analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity through morphological characters of spores and intraradicular hyphae has suggested previously that preferential associations occur between plants and AM fungi. A field experiment was established to investigate whether AM fungal diversity is affected by different host plants in upland grasslands. Indigenous vegetation from plots in an unimproved pasture was replaced with monocultures of either Agrostis capillaris or Lolium perenne. Modification of the diversity of AM fungi in these plots was evaluated by analysis of partial sequences in the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA (rDNA) genes. General primers for AM fungi were designed for the PCR amplification of partial sequences using DNA extracted from root tissues of A. capillaris and L. perenne. PCR products were used to construct LSU rDNA libraries. Sequencing of randomly selected clones indicated that plant roots were colonised by AM fungi belonging to the genera Glomus, Acaulospora and Scutellospora. There was a difference in the diversity of AM fungi colonising roots of A. capillaris and L. perenne that was confirmed by PCR using primers specific for each sequence group. These molecular data suggest the existence of a selection pressure of plants on AM fungal communities.},

abstract = {Rice-duck farming is one of the traditional, but current and gradually popularized, ecological farming techniques for paddy rice production in China. In comparison to rice monoculture farming, we investigated a weed community and weed infestation in a transplanted rice-duck farming system and examined the effects of duck activities on the weeds. Three treatments were imposed in the experiment: a rice-duck coculture with duck grazing and disturbance effects, a rice-duck coculture with duck disturbance effects only, and a control (rice monoculture, no duck effects). Rice seedlings were nursed and transplanted in this experiment. The total number of weed species was significantly lower in the treatment with both duck grazing and disturbance and in the treatment with duck disturbance only than in the monoculture rice treatment (control). The Shannon-Wiener Biodiversity Index of the weed species decreased but the Pielou Evenness Index increased in both treatments with ducks compared to the monoculture control. Sorensen's coefficient of similarity of the weed communities was low between the treatments with ducks and the monoculture control, implying that the weed communities diverged. The total density and biomass of the weed community in both the treatments with ducks were significantly lower compared to the monoculture control. However, compared to the rice monoculture control, the weed biomass was reduced by 98{\%} in the treatment with duck grazing and disturbance and by 84{\%} in the treatment with duck disturbance only, implying that only 14{\%} of the weeds were controlled by duck grazing and that 84{\%} of the weed biomass was inhibited by duck activities in the rice field with ducks. The rice grain yield increased in the treatments with ducks compared to the control. The results suggested that duck activities, like grazing weeds and disturbance of the soil and water, had a significant effect on the weed community structure and that weeds could be well controlled without herbicide application under a rice-duck farming system.},

abstract = {1. Bees are a functionally important and economically valuable group, but are threatened by land-use conversion and intensification. Such pressures are not expected to affect all species identically; rather, they are likely to be mediated by the species' ecological traits. 2. Understanding which types of species are most vulnerable under which land uses is an important step towards effective conservation planning. 3. We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584 European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70 056 records) and combined them with spe- cies-level ecological trait data. We used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of vegetation), traits and trait 9 land-use interactions, in explaining species occurrence and abundance. 4. Species' sensitivity to land use was most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range, but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats. 5. Synthesis and applications. Rather than targeting particular species or settings, conserva- tion actions may be more effective if focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and negatively interact with land-use pressures. We find evidence that low-intensity agriculture can maintain relatively diverse bee communities; in more intensive settings, added floral resources may be beneficial, but will require careful placement with respect to foraging ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of semi-natural habitats is essential, however; in par- ticular, conversion to urban environments could have severe effects on bee diversity and polli- nation services. Our results highlight the importance of exploring how ecological traits mediate species responses to human impacts, but further research is needed to enhance the predictive ability of such analyses.},

abstract = {Studies of biodiversity–ecosystem function in treed ecosystems have generally focused on aboveground functions. This study investigates intertrophic links between tree diversity and soil microbial community function and composition. We examined how microbial communities in surface mineral soil responded to experimental gradients of tree species richness (SR), functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean trait value (CWM), and tree identity. The site was a 4-year-old common garden experiment near Montreal, Canada, consisting of deciduous and evergreen tree species mixtures. Microbial community composition, community-level physiological profiles, and respiration were evaluated using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and the MicroResp™ system, respectively. The relationship between tree species richness and glucose-induced respiration (GIR), basal respiration (BR), metabolic quotient (qCO2) followed a positive but saturating shape. Microbial communities associated with species mixtures were more active (basal respiration [BR]), with higher biomass (glucose-induced respiration [GIR]), and used a greater number of carbon sources than monocultures. Communities associated with deciduous tree species used a greater number of carbon sources than those associated with evergreen species, suggesting a greater soil carbon storage capacity. There were no differences in microbial composition (PLFA) between monocultures and SR mixtures. The FD and the CWM of several functional traits affected both BR and GIR. In general, the CWM of traits had stronger effects than did FD, suggesting that certain traits of dominant species have more effect on ecosystem processes than does FD. Both the functions of GIR and BR were positively related to aboveground tree community productivity. Both tree diversity (SR) and identity (species and functional identity—leaf habit) affected soil microbial community respiration, biomass, and composition. For the first time, we identified functional traits related to life-history strategy, as well as root traits that influence another trophic level, soil microbial community function, via effects on BR and GIR.},

Because environmental conditions are often more extreme on rooftops, many xerophytic plants, especially Sedum, are ideal for extensive green roofs because they are physiologically and morphologically adapted to withstand drought. A green- house experiment was conducted to determine the effect of watering regimens on plant stress as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), biomass accumulation, substrate moisture, and evapotransipiration on succulent plants of Sedum acre L., S. reflexum L., S. kamtschaticum ellacombianum Fisch., and non-Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants of Schizachyrium scoparium Nash and Coreopsis lanceolata L. Plants were grown at a substrate depth of 7.5 cm. Results indicate even after the 4-month period, Sedum spp. survived and maintained active photosynthetic metabolism to a greater extent than Schizachyrium and Coreopsis. Furthermore, when Sedum was watered after 28 days of drought, chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) values recovered to values characteristic of the 2 days between watering (DBW) treatment. In contrast, the non-CAM plants required watering frequency every other day to survive and maintain active growth and development. Regardless of species, the greatest increase in total biomass accumulation and fastest growth occurred under the 2 DBW regimens.},

CP were xerothermophilous habitats similar to cliffs, whereas SM and FL were damp and cool habitats, similar to vegetated waterfalls. These differences in local scale properties influenced more arthropod assemblages than landscape properties, which showed higher species richness and abundance in SM and lower ones in bare walls. Fa{\c{c}}ade types clearly sheltered different beetles' assemblages in terms of species and traits, including more affine to damp habitat in SM and FL than the other types. Despite the presence of few rare species of Northern France, the assemblages of spiders were dominated by generalist species.Our results show the capacity of vegetated fa{\c{c}}ades to shelter arthropods and argue for their development in cities.},

However, treatment wetland technol- ogies have not been used extensively in the tropics. To advance tropical studies, a pilot-scale SSFW was constructed on the campus of the University of the Atlantic in Barranquilla, Colombia. The systems performance was monitored from January to July of 2009. The treatment system consisted of a 760-L septic tank followed by three mesocsom-scale subsurface-flow constructed wetlands in parallel arrangement. Clarified wastewater was batch loaded to each unit at a rate of 53 L/m2/day to affect a hydraulic retention time of approximately 3 days. One of the treatment units served as a non-planted control (gravel only), while the other two treatment units were planted with either Eriochloa aristata or Eleocharis mutata. The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of the treatment units (planted vs. unplanted), with respect to their abilities to augment treatment of septic tank effluent (sanitary wastewater).

abstract = {The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

abstract = {Understanding how trees respond to global change drivers is central to predict changes in forest structure and functions. Although there is evidence on the mode of nitrogen (N) and drought (D) effects on tree growth, our understanding of the interplay of these factors is still limited. Simultaneously, as mixtures are expected to be less sensitive to global change as compared to monocultures, we aimed to investigate the combined effects of N addition and D on the productivity of three tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea, Pseudotsuga menziesii) in relation to functional diverse species mixtures using data from a four-year field experiment in Northwest Germany. Here we show that species mixing can mitigate the negative effects of combined N fertilization and D events, but the community response is mainly driven by the combination of certain traits rather than the tree species richness of a community. For beech, we found that negative effects of D on growth rates were amplified by N fertilization (i.e. combined treatment effects were non-additive), while for oak and fir, the simultaneous effects of N and D were additive. Beech and oak were identified as most sensitive to combined N+D effects with a strong size-dependency observed for beech, suggesting that the negative impact of N+D becomes stronger with time as beech grows larger. As a consequence, the net biodiversity effect declined at the community level, which can be mainly assigned to a distinct loss of complementarity in beech-oak mixtures. This pattern, however, was not evident in the other species-mixtures, indicating that neighborhood composition (i.e. trait combination), but not tree species richness mediated the relationship between tree diversity and treatment effects on tree growth. Our findings point to the importance of the qualitative role (‘trait portfolio') that biodiversity play in determining resistance of diverse tree communities to environmental changes. As such, they provide further understanding for adaptive management strategies in the context of global change.},

We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. A coordinated continental-scale field experiment across 31 sites was used to compare the biomass yield of monocultures and four species mixtures associated with intensively managed agricultural grassland systems. To increase complementarity in resource use, each of the four spe- cies in the experimental design represented a distinct functional type derived from two levels of each of two functional traits, nitrogen acquisition (N2-fixing legume or nonfixing grass) crossed with temporal development (fast-establishing or temporally persistent). Relative abundances of the four functional types in mixtures were systematically varied at sowing to vary the evenness of the same four species in mixture communities at each site and sown at two levels of seed density. 2. Across multiple years, the total yield (including weed biomass) of the mixtures exceeded that of the average monoculture in {\textgreater}97{\%} of comparisons. It also exceeded that of the best monoculture (transgressive overyielding) in about 60{\%} of sites, with a mean yield ratio of mixture to best-performing monoculture of 107 across all sites. Analyses based on yield of sown species only (excluding weed biomass) demonstrated considerably greater transgressive overyielding (significant at about 70{\%} of sites, ratio of mixture to best-performing monocul- ture = 118). 3. Mixtures maintained a resistance to weed invasion over at least 3 years. In mixtures, median values indicate {\textless}4{\%} of weed biomass in total yield, whereas the median percentage of weeds in monocultures increased from 15{\%} in year 1 to 32{\%} in year 3. 4. Within each year, there was a highly significant relationship (P {\textless}00001) between sward evenness and the diversity effect (excess of mixture performance over that predicted from the monoculture performances of component species). At lower evenness values, increases in com- munity evenness resulted in an increased diversity effect, but the diversity effect was not sig- nificantly different from the maximum diversity effect across a wide range of higher evenness values. The latter indicates the robustness of the diversity effect to changes in species' relative abundances. 5. Across sites with three complete years of data (24 of the 31 sites), the effect of interac- tions between the fast-establishing and temporal persistent trait levels of temporal develop- ment was highly significant and comparable in magnitude to effects of interactions between N2-fixing and nonfixing trait levels of nitrogen acquisition. 6. Synthesis and applications. The design of grassland mixtures is relevant to farm-level strat- egies to achieve sustainable intensification. Experimental evidence indicated significant yield benefits of four species agronomic mixtures which yielded more than the highest-yielding monoculture at most sites. The results are relevant for agricultural practice and show how grassland mixtures can be designed to improve resource complementarity, increase yields and reduce weed invasion. The yield benefits were robust to considerable changes in the relative proportions of the four species, which is extremely useful for practical management of grass- land swards.},

abstract = {Background and aims  This paper provides an overview of the measuring capabilities of IJ{\_}Rhizo, an ImageJ macro that measures scanned images of washed root samples. IJ{\_}Rhizo is open-source, platform-independent and offers a simple graphic user interface (GUI) for a main audience of non-programmer scientists. Being open-source based, it is also fully modifiable to accommodate the specific needs of the more computer-literate users. A comparison of IJ{\_}Rhizo's performance with that of the widely used commercial package WinRHIZO™ is discussed. Methods  We compared IJ{\_}Rhizo's performance with that of the commercial package WinRHIZO™ using two sets of images, one comprising test-line images, the second consisting of images of root samples collected in the field. IJ{\_}Rhizo and WinRHIZO™ estimates were compared by means of correlation and regression analysis. Results  IJ{\_}Rhizo “Kimura” and WinRHIZO™ “Tennant” were the length estimates that were best linearly correlated with each other. Correlation between average root diameter estimates was weaker, due to the sensitivity of this parameter to thresholding and filtering of image background noise. Conclusions  Overall, IJ{\_}Rhizo offers new opportunities for researchers who cannot afford the cost of commercial software packages to carry out automated measurement of scanned images of root samples, without sacrificing accuracy.},

abstract = {1.Biodiversity can insure ecosystems against declines in their functioning by increasing the mean level of ecosystem processes and decreasing the spatial or temporal variance of these processes. On this basis, mixing tree species is expected to be an effective management strategy to reduce the risk of planting failure in young plantations.2.We examined the effects of diversity insurance on sapling survival in three tree diversity experiments across Belgium. Based on the survival scoring of 89 254 saplings, planted in 126 plots with up to four species mixtures, we tested two hypotheses: (i) variability in plot-level survival is lower for mixtures compared to monocultures due to compensation among the species (i.e. buffering effect) and (ii) mean survival is higher due to facilitation (i.e. performance-enhancing effect).3.Variation in plot-level survival decreased strongly with diversity, indicating a buffering effect. The risk of severe planting failure was reduced in mixtures because species exhibit different survival rates; therefore, mixing ensures that not all trees in the plantation are equally susceptible to environmental stressors. In contrast, the mean plot-level survival did not increase with diversity, and thus an overall performance-enhancing effect was lacking. However, species-level analyses did show performance-enhancing effects, where some species profited from mixing while others did not.4.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that biodiversity through mixing tree species insures young experimental plantations against planting failure and is therefore highly recommended as a planting management strategy. The risk of large mortality gaps is reduced if tree plantation saplings are mixed at the scale of individual trees or small cells of trees.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {1 Plant species differ in their capacity to influence soil organic matter, soil nutrient availability and the composition of soil microbial communities. Their influences on soil properties result in net positive or negative feedback effects, which influence plant performance and plant community composition. 2 For two grassland systems, one on a sandy soil in the Netherlands and one on a chalk soil in the United Kingdom, we investigated how individual plant species grown in monocultures changed abiotic and biotic soil conditions. Then, we determined feedback effects of these soils to plants of the same or different species. Feedback effects were analysed at the level of plant species and plant taxonomic groups (grasses vs. forbs). 3 In the sandy soils, plant species differed in their effects on soil chemical properties, in particular potassium levels, but PLFA (phospholipid fatty acid) signatures of the soil microbial community did not differ between plant species. The effects of soil chemical properties were even greater when grasses and forbs were compared, especially because potassium levels were lower in grass monocultures. 4 In the chalk soil, there were no effects of plant species on soil chemical properties, but PLFA profiles differed significantly between soils from different monocultures. PLFA profiles differed between species, rather than between grasses and forbs. 5 In the feedback experiment, all plant species in sandy soils grew less vigorously in soils conditioned by grasses than in soils conditioned by forbs. These effects correlated significantly with soil chemical properties. None of the seven plant species showed significant differences between performance in soil conditioned by the same vs. other plant species. 6 In the chalk soil, Sanguisorba minor and in particular Briza media performed best in soil collected from conspecifics, while Bromus erectus performed best in soil from heterospecifics. There was no distinctive pattern between soils collected from forb and grass monocultures, and plant performance could not be related to soil chemical properties or PLFA signatures. 7 Our study shows that mechanisms of plant-soil feedback can depend on plant species, plant taxonomic (or functional) groups and site-specific differences in abiotic and biotic soil properties. Understanding how plant species can influence their rhizosphere, and how other plant species respond to these changes, will greatly enhance our understanding of the functioning and stability of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Dominance by free-floating plants results in a loss of plant species in many waters. An important source for re-establishment of non-floating aquatic plants can be the propagule bank. This study focuses on whether the propag- ule bank of free-floating plant–dominated ditch sediments can serve as potential source for recovery of a diverse plant community. The first objective was to determine differ- ences in propagule germination from sediments of ditches in the Netherlands that differ in vegetation composition through a seedling-emergence experiment. The second objective was to analyze the effect of sediment disturbance on the number of germinating propagules. The results show that, compared to sediments from ditches with submerged vegetation, sediments from free-floating plant–dominated ditches produced significantly lower numbers of indi- viduals and species of submerged and emergent plants, while numbers of individuals and species of free-floating plants were higher. These results suggest that sediments from free-floating plant–dominated ditches have lower potential to recover a diverse plant community proba- bly resulting from positive feedback mechanisms caused by the vegetation present, maintaining the free-floating plant–dominated state. Sediment disturbance strongly favors the germination of free-floating plant propagules, especially from free-floating plant–dominated ditch sedi- ments. Ditch maintenance activities such as mowing and dredging will therefore likely favor persistence of the free- floating plant–dominated state. To shift from dominance by free-floating plants to a more diverse plant community, alternativemaintenance methods should be considered that cause less sediment disturbance together with measures that promote colonization such as temporary drawdown or re-introduction of species.},

abstract = {Green roofs are of increasing interest to ecologists, engineers and architects, as cities grow and aim to become more sustainable. They could be exploited to improve urban biodiversity and ecosystem services, yet almost nothing is known about them from a soil community ecology perspective, despite how critical soil food webs are to ecosystem functioning. This paper provides the first comprehensive study incorporating the annual cycle of green roof soil microarthropods.Microarthropod communities were monitored over 14 months on two extensive green roofs. Abiotic factors, including substrate moisture, were recorded, as were biotic factors such as plant and mycorrhizal colonisation. Microarthropod interactions with these variables were then examined.Microarthropod diversity was low overall, with a few dominant species peaking seasonally. On occasion, total abundance was comparable to other early successional soils. The majority of species present were drought tolerant collembola and xerophillic mites, suggesting that moisture levels on green roofs are a major limiting factor for soil microarthropods.Our results suggest that the microarthropod community present in extensive green roof soils is impoverished, limiting the success of above-ground flora and fauna and ultimately the success of the roof as an urban habitat. We conclude that green roof building guidelines should incorporate soil communities in their design and should aim to be heterogeneous at the roof and landscape level, for the purpose of supporting soil biodiversity and creating sustainable habitats. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We studied the effect of forest tree species on a community of decomposers that colonize cellulose strips. Both fungal and bacterial communities were targeted in a native forest dominated by beech and oak and 30-year-old beech and spruce plantations, growing in similar ecological conditions in the Breuil-Chenue experimental forest site in Morvan (France). Microbial ingrowths from the 3rd to 10th month of strip decomposition (May to December 2004) were studied. Community composition was assessed using temperature gradient gel electrophoresis with universal fungal (ITS1F, ITS2) and bacterial (1401r, 968f) primers. Soil temperature and moisture as well as fungal biomass were also measured to give additional information on decomposition processes. Changing the dominant tree species had no significant influence in the number of decomposer species. However, decomposer community composition was clearly different. If compared to the native forest, where community composition highly differed, young monocultures displayed similar species structure for fungi and bacteria. Both species numbers and community composition evolved during the decay process. Time effect was found to be more important than tree species. Nevertheless, the actual environmental conditions and seasonal effect seemed to be even more determining factors for the development of microbial communities. The course and correlations of the explored variables often differed between tree species, although certain general trends were identified. Fungal biomass was high in summer, despite that species richness (SR) decreased and conversely, that high SR did not necessarily mean high biomass values. It can be concluded that the growth and development of the microbiological communities that colonized a model material in situ depended on the combination of physical and biological factors acting collectively and interdependently at the forest soil microsite.},

abstract = {The role of species richness, functional diversity and species identity of native Florida sandhill understory species were tested with Imperata cylindrica, an exotic rhizomatous grass, in mesocosms. I. cylindrica was introduced 1 year after the following treatments were established: a control with no native species, five monocultures, a grass mix treatment, a forb mix treatment, and a 3-species treatment and a 5-species treatment. Monthly cover, final biomass, root length, root length density (RLD) and specific root length (SRL) of all species were determined for one full growing season. There was a significant negative linear relationship between the cover of native species and I. cylindrica (r (2) = 0.59, P = 0.01) and a negative logarithmic relationship between the biomass of native species and I. cylindrica (r (2) = 0.70, P = 0.003). There was no diversity-invasibility relationship. Grasses proved to be the most resistant functional group providing resistance alone and in mixed functional communities. Repeated measures analysis demonstrated that treatments including Andropogon virginicus were the most resistant to invasion over time (P {\textless} 0.001). Significantly greater root length (P = 0.002), RLD (P = 0.011) and SRL (P {\textless} 0.001) than all of the native species and I. cylindrica in monocultures and in mixed communities made A. virginicus successful. The root morphology characteristics allowed it to be a great competitor belowground where I. cylindrica was most aggressive. The results suggest that species identity could be more important than species or functional richness in determining community resistance to invasion.},

In this study, a litter mixing experiment was conducted using litterbags in a Pinus koraiensis mixed broad-leaved forest of the Changbai Mountains, in which the treatments consisted of litter monocultures of each of four canopy tree species, namely P. koraiensis, Fraxinus mandshurica, Tilia amurensis and Acer mono, as well as mixtures of two and four different species. It was found that the different litter species decomposed in monoculture at different rates. The litter mixing had idiosyncratic effects on the decomposition, which depended on the field incubation time and composition species. Litter species identity was an important determinant of abundances and diversity of soil fauna, while litter mixing had weak or no significant effects on the soil fauna communities. The study results also showed that soil fauna has an important influence on litter decomposition; however, the extent of the relationship between decomposition and soil fauna was not stronger in the litter mixtures than in the monocultures. It is concluded that litter mixing had effects on decomposition, with relatively minor effects on soil fauna communities in comparison to the effects of litter species identity. ?? 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Environmental policies in African rangelands affect development and welfare as well as environmental measures. Biodiversity is widely perceived as declining, and environments as undergoing degradation, through rural population growth and resource use. These assumptions are often underpinned by environmental discourses contesting control of natural resources, rather than by objectively measured trends and causalities. Orthodox biodiversity conservation policy advocates fortress conservation. Savanna species do better where they can disperse across wider landscapes with conservation-compatible rural land uses, rather than isolated in protected areas, but community-based conservation initiatives have been disappointing. Policies addressing land degradation, and their underlying assumptions, are subject to similar challenges. The paper outlines a natural experiment investigating biodiversity and land cover changes 1975-1995 for 100,000 km2cross-border rangeland including the Serengeti-Mara conservation areas and their buffer zones. Ecological, ethnic and micro-economic continuities make it possible to control for confounding factors and identify main drivers of change. Privatisation of formerly communal rangeland, and its conversion to commercial monoculture, have driven drastic land cover and wildlife declines in Kenya. Population growth and agropastoral land use were not significant factors. The gap between natural and social science, and western versus local understandings, needs bridging to achieve more effective environmental policy. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Functional traits are receiving increasing attention as the main ecological attributes by which different organisms and biological communities influence ecosystem services through their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here we synthesize concepts and empirical evidence on linkages between functional traits and ecosystem services across different trophic levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed considered plants and soil invertebrates, but quantitative trait–service associations have been documented for a range of organisms and ecosystems, illustrating the wide applicability of the trait approach. Within each trophic level, specific processes are affected by a combination of traits while particular key traits are simultaneously involved in the control of multiple processes. These multiple associations between traits and ecosystem processes can help to identify predictable trait–service clusters that depend on several trophic levels, such as clusters of traits of plants and soil organisms that underlie nutrient cycling, herbivory, and fodder and fibre production. We propose that the assessment of trait–service clusters will represent a crucial step in ecosystem service monitoring and in balancing the delivery of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, services in ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Soil food webs comprise a multitude of trophic interactions that can affect the composition and productivity of plant communities. Belowground predators feeding on microbial grazers like Collembola could decelerate nutrient mineralization by reducing microbial turnover in the soil, which in turn could negatively influence plant growth. However, empirical evidences for the ecological significance of belowground predators on nutrient cycling and plant communities are scarce. Here, we manipulated predator density (Hypoaspis aculeifer: predatory mite) with equal densities of three Collembola species as a prey in four functionally dissimilar plant communities in experimental microcosms: grass monoculture (Poa pratensis), herb monoculture (Rumex acetosa), legume monoculture (Trifolium pratense), and all three species as a mixed plant community. Density manipulation of predators allowed us to test for density-mediated effects of belowground predators on Collembola and lower trophic groups. We hypothesized that predator density will reduce Collembola population causing a decrease in nutrient mineralization and hence detrimentally affect plant growth. First, we found a density-dependent population change in predators, that is, an increase in low-density treatments, but a decrease in high-density treatments. Second, prey suppression was lower at high predator density, which caused a shift in the soil microbial community by increasing the fungal: bacterial biomass ratio, and an increase of nitrification rates, particularly in legume monocultures. Despite the increase in nutrient mineralization, legume monocultures performed worse at high predator density. Further, individual grass shoot biomass decreased in monocultures, while it increased in mixed plant communities with increasing predator density, which coincided with elevated soil N uptake by grasses. As a consequence, high predator density significantly increased plant complementarity effects indicating a decrease in interspecific plant competition. These results highlight that belowground predators can relax interspecific plant competition by increasing nutrient mineralization through their density-dependent cascading effects on detritivore and soil microbial communities.},

abstract = {Research on rain gardens generally focuses on hydrology, geochemistry, and vegetation. The role of soil invertebrates has largely been overlooked, despite their well-known impacts on soil nutrient storage, removal, and processing. Surveys of three rain gardens in Melbourne, Australia, revealed a soil invertebrate community structure that differed significantly among sites but was stable across sampling dates (July 2013 and April 2014). Megadrilacea (earthworms), Enchytraeidae (potworms), and Collembola (springtails) were abundant in all sites, and together accounted for a median of 80{\%} of total soil invertebrate abundance. Earthworms were positively correlated to soil organic matter content, but the abundances of other taxonomic groups were not strongly related to organic matter content, plant cover, or root biomass across sites. While less than 5{\%} of total soil N was estimated to be stored in the body tissues of these three taxa, and estimated N gas emissions from earthworms (N2O and N2) were low, ingestion and processing of soil was high (e.g., up to 417{\%} of the upper 5 cm of soil ingested by earthworms annually in one site), suggesting that the contribution of these organisms to N cycling in rain gardens may be substantial. Thus, invertebrate communities represent an overlooked feature of rain garden design that can play an important role in the structure and function of these systems.},

We conducted a plant diversity experiment in a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland for treating domestic wastewater in southeastern China. Plant aboveground biomass production ranged from 20 to 3121gm-2yr-1across all plant communities. In general, plant biomass production was positively correlated with species richness (P=0.001) and functional group richness (P=0.001). Substrate nitrate concentration increased significantly with increasing plant species richness (P=0.046), but not with functional group richness (P=0.550). Furthermore, legumes did not affect biomass production (P=0.255), retention of substrate nitrate (P=0.280) and ammonium (P=0.269). Compared to the most productive of the corresponding monocultures, transgressive overyielding of mixed plant communities did not occur in most polycultures. Because greater diversity of plant community led to higher biomass production and substrate nitrogen retention, thus we recommend that plant biodiversity should be incorporated in constructed wetlands to improve wastewater treatment efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract: Trees partition rainfall into throughfall and stemflow, resulting in a spatial distribution of nutrient and water fluxes reaching the soil centred on the trunks of trees. Stemflow fluxes of water and nutrients are then funneled preferentially belowground along tree roots and other preferential flow paths, bypassing much of the bulk soil. This double funneling leads to increased soil chemical, biological, and hydrological heterogeneity, which has been shown to persist for decades. In this paper, we review nutrient fluxes of stemflow water for a variety of tree species and climates. The amount of precipitation partitioned by trees to stemflow ranges over more than three orders of magnitude, accounting for 0.07-22{\%} of incident rainfall in a range of precipitation regimes (600-7100 mm.y-i). Stemflow fluxes of NO3- and K were found to be larger for species with greater stemflow partitioning, regardless of climate type. While sternflow volumes may increase in relation to increasing precipitation, stemflow nutrient concentrations tend to become more dilute. On an annual basis, however, it appears that plant canopy morphology is strongly related to stemflow fluxes for plant-mobile nutrients such as K (r2 = 0.64) and NO3- (r2 = 0.61). Root-induced preferential flow provides an additional feedback mechanism in nutrient cycling by which stemflow-derived nutrient fluxes are delivered to the rhizosphere},

abstract = {In many no-till (NT) systems, residue input is low and fallow periods excessive, for which reasons soil degradation occurs. Cover crops could improve organic matter, biological activity, and soil structure. In order to study changes in soil carbon, nitrogen and microbial biomass a field experiment (2010-2012) was set up with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench.) monoculture and with cover crops. Treatments were control (NT with bare fallow), rye (Secale cereale L.) (R), rye with nitrogen fertilization (R + N), vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) (V), and rye-vetch mixture (VR) cover crops. A completely randomized block design with 4 replicates was used. Soil was sampled once a year at 0.06 and 0.12 m depth for total C, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and-nitrogen (MBN) determinations. Shoot and root biomass of sorghum and cover crops, litter biomass, and their respective carbon and nitrogen contents were determined. Soil temperatures at 0.06 and 0.12 m depth, volumetric water contents and nitrate concentrations were determined at sowing, and harvest of each crop, and during sorghum's vegetative phase. NT led to a small increase in MBC and MBN, despite low litter and root biomass residue. Cover crops increased litter, root biomass, total C, MBC, and MBN. Relationships between MBC, MBN, and root-C and -N adjusted to logistic models (R2= 0.61 and 0.43 for C and N respectively). Litter cover improved soil moisture to 45-50{\%} water filled pore space and soil temperatures not exceeding 25 °C during the warmest month. Microbial biomass stabilized at 20.1 g C m-2and 1.9 g N m-2in the upper 0.06 m. Soil litter disappearance was a good indicator of mineral N availability. These findings support the view that cover crops, specifically legumes in NT systems can increase soil ecosystem services related to water and carbon storage, habitat for biodiversity, and nutrient availability.},

I present a simple ecosystem model in which primary producers (plants) and decomposers (microbes) are linked through material cycling. The model considers a diversity of plant organic compounds and a diversity of microbial species. Nutrient recycling efficiency from organic compounds to decomposers is then the key parameter that controls ecosystem processes (primary productivity, secondary productivity, producer biomass and decomposer biomass). The model predicts that microbial diversity has a positive effect on nutrient recycling efficiency and ecosystem processes through either greater intensity of microbial exploitation of organic compounds or functional niche complementarity, much like in plants. Microbial niche breadth and overlap should not affect ecosystem processes unless they increase the number of organic compounds that are decomposed. In contrast, the model predicts that plant organic compound diversity can only have a negative effect or, at best, no effect on ecosystem processes, at least in a constant environment. This creates a tension between the effects of plant diversity and microbial diversity on ecosystem functioning, which may explain some recent experimental results.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in 2001, MrBayes has grown in popularity as a software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site d(N)/d(S) rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.},

abstract = {Many biofilm populations are known for their exceptional biodiversity, but the relative contributions of the forces that could produce this diversity are poorly understood. This uncertainty grows in the old, well-established communities found on many natural surfaces and in long-term, chronic infections. If the prevailing interactions among species within biofilms are positive, productivity should increase with diversity, but if they tend towards competition or antagonism, productivity should decrease. Here, we describe the parallel evolution of synergistic communities derived from a clone of Burkholderia cenocepacia during {\~{}}1500 generations of biofilm selection. This long-term evolution was enabled by a new experimental method that selects for daily cycles of colonization, biofilm assembly and dispersal. Each of the six replicate biofilm populations underwent a common pattern of adaptive morphological diversification, in which three ecologically distinct morphotypes arose in the same order of succession and persisted. In two focal populations, mixed communities were more productive than any monoculture and each variant benefited from the mixture. These gains in output resulted from asymmetrical cross-feeding between ecotypes and the expansion and partitioning of biofilm space that constructed new niches. Therefore, even in the absence of starting genetic variation, prolonged selection for surface colonization generates a dynamic of ecological succession that enhances productivity.},

Ecological and evolutionary research increasingly uses quantitative synthesis of primary research studies (meta-analysis) for answering fundamental questions, informing environmental policy and summarizing results for decision makers. 2. Knowing how meta-analysis works is important for researchers so that their research can have broader impact. Meta-analytic thinking encourages scientists to see single primary research studies as substantial contri-butions to a larger picture. 3. To facilitate inclusion in a meta-analysis, relevant primary research studies must be found and basic informa-tion about the methods and results must be thoroughly, clearly and transparently reported. While many pub-lished papers provide this information, it is common for essential data to be omitted, leading to study exclusion from meta-analyses. 4. We provide guidelines for correctly reporting basic data needed from primary studies in ecology and evolu-tionary biology so that they can be included in meta-analyses, together with examples that show how data should be reported to enable calculation and analysis of effect sizes, and how data should be made accessible. 5. These guidelines are important for reporting research results in general, whether or not results are included in subsequent meta-analyses, because they are necessary for the interpretation and assessment of study outcomes. Increased implementation of these guidelines by authors, editors and publishers, and reinforcement by funders, will foster higher quality and more inclusive syntheses, further the goals of transparency and reproducibility in science, and improve the quality and value of primary research studies.},

abstract = {1. Functional root traits are becoming a key measure in plant ecology, and root length measurements are needed for the calculation of root traits. Several methods are used to estimate the total root length (TRL) of washed root samples [e.g. modified line intersect (LI) method, WinRHIZO TM and IJ{\_}Rhizo], but no standardized compar-ison of methods exists. 2. We used a set of digital images of unstained root samples to compare measurements given by the LI method and automated methods provided by WinRHIZO TM and IJ{\_}Rhizo. Linear regression models were used to detect bias. Both linear regression models and the Bland-Altman's method of differences were used to evaluate the accu-racy of eight methods (1 manual, 2 semi-automated and 5 automated) in comparison with a reference method that avoided root detection errors. 3. Length measurements were highly correlated, but did not exactly agree with each other in 11 of 12 method comparisons. All tested methods tended to underestimate the TRL of unstained root samples. The accuracy of WinRHIZO TM was influenced by the thresholding method and the root length density (RLD) in the pictures. For the other methods, no linear relationship was found between accuracy and RLD. With WinRHIZO TM (glo-bal thresholding + pixel reclassification; RLD = 1 cm cm {\`{A}}2), the Regent's method and the Tennant's method underestimated the TRL by 7{\'{A}}0 AE 6{\'{A}}2{\%} and 4{\'{A}}7 AE 7{\'{A}}9{\%}, respectively. The LI method gave satisfactory results on average (underestimation: 4{\'{A}}2 AE 6{\'{A}}0{\%}), but our results suggest that it can lead to inaccurate estimations for single images. In IJ{\_}Rhizo, the Kimura method was the best and underestimated the TRL by 5{\'{A}}4 AE 6{\'{A}}1{\%}. 4. Our results showed that care must be taken when comparing measurements acquired with different methods because they can lead to different results. When acquiring root images, we advise to (i) increase the contrast between fine roots and background by staining the roots, and (ii) avoid overlapping roots by not exceeding a RLD of 1 cm cm {\`{A}}2 . Under these conditions, good length estimates can be obtained with WinRHIZO TM (global thresholding + pixel reclassification). The Kimura method in IJ{\_}Rhizo can be an alternative to WinRHIZO TM .},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Litter often decomposes faster in its environment of origin (at 'home') than in a foreign environment ('away'), which has become known as the home-field advantage (HFA). However, many studies have highlighted the conditional nature of the HFA, suggesting that current understanding of this phenomenon is not yet sufficient to generalize across systems. METHODS The HFA hypothesis was tested for mono-specific and mixed-species litter using a tree-based experiment that manipulated the functional identity and diversity of the host tree community. Litter types of varying quality were transplanted between several host tree communities and decomposition rates were measured using litterbags. Since the decomposer community should respond to traits of the litter input and not their taxonomic identity, a traits-based index of litter-tree similarity was developed. KEY RESULTS Mono-specific litter exhibited HFA, but when the same litter was decomposed in mixture, this trend was not observed. Mixed-species litter decomposed on average no faster or slower than monoculture litter and exhibited both positive and negative species interactions. These non-additive interactions of decomposition rates in mixture were influenced by the degree of similarity between litter and tree traits. Both synergistic and antagonistic interactions decreased in magnitude with increasing litter-tree similarity such that mixture rates were predictable from monocultures. CONCLUSIONS The HFA occurred more strongly for mono-specific litter than for the litter types mixed together because interactions between species may have masked this effect. However, when expressed as a function of trait similarity between litters and tree communities, the HFA was not detected.},

abstract = {1. Agriculture now constitutes 40–50{\%} of terrestrial land use globally. By enhancing habitat suitability and connectivity, restoration within agricultural landscapes could have a major influence on biodiversity conservation. However, habitat management within intensive agri- cultural landscapes may primarily boost abundances of common, highly mobile generalists, rather than vulnerable or endangered species. We studied pollinator community response to small-scale habitat restoration in the intensively farmed Central Valley of California to deter- mine whether restoration could also promote more specialized, less common and/or less mobile species. 2. Composition of pollinator communities was assessed in five experimental and 10 control (unrestored) sites before and after restoration of native plant hedgerows over an 8-year per- iod, using a before-after control-impact design. 3. We characterized bee and fly species based on functional response traits [floral specializa- tion, habitat specialization, abundance, body size and sociality (bees only)] known to influ- ence the response to habitat change. 4. We modelled how species occurrences changed with habitat restoration over time as mod- ulated by their response traits. 5. We found that hedgerows not only significantly enhanced occurrences of native bee and syrphid fly species, but that as hedgerows matured, they had a greater positive effect on spe- cies that were more specialized in floral and nesting resources and smaller (less mobile). 6. Synthesis and applications. Unlike previous studies that suggest habitat restoration in agri- cultural landscapes only benefits mobile, generalist species, our results suggest that small-scale habitat restoration can promote species whose traits likely render them particularly vulnerable to habitat degradation. Thus, even within highly intensive agricultural landscapes, small-scale habitat restoration can be a conservation management tool. However, tailoring habitat enhancements to promote certain species or guilds may be critical for their success as a con- servation intervention in agricultural landscapes.},

abstract = {Accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted a growing number of researchers to manipulate the richness of various groups of organisms and examine how this aspect of diversity impacts ecological processes that control the functioning of ecosystems. We summarize the results of 44 experiments that have manipulated the richness of plants to examine how plant diversity affects the production of biomass. We show that mixtures of species produce an average of 1.7 times more biomass than species monocultures and are more productive than the average monoculture in 79{\%} of all experiments. However, in only 12{\%} of all experiments do diverse polycultures achieve greater biomass than their single most productive species. Previously, a positive net effect of diversity that is no greater than the most productive species has been interpreted as evidence for selection effects, which occur when diversity maximizes the chance that highly productive species will be included in and ultimately dominate the biomass of polycultures. Contrary to this, we show that although productive species do indeed contribute to diversity effects, these contributions are equaled or exceeded by species complementarity, where biomass is augmented by biological processes that involve multiple species. Importantly, both the net effect of diversity and the probability of polycultures being more productive than their most productive species increases through time, because the magnitude of complementarity increases as experiments are run longer. Our results suggest that experiments to date have, if anything, underestimated the impacts of species extinction on the productivity of ecosystems.},

We measured decomposition rates (mg g?1 d?1) of mixed-species leaf litter from two experimental designs: 1) a microcosm experiment with litterbags of species mixtures combining six tree species, alone and in 42 combinations, and 2) an in situ litterbag experiment with all possible mixture combinations of four herb species (from one to four species). Interaction strengths and directions were measured as deviations from community-weighted means (CWM) of monoculture decompo- sition values, following the biomass-ratio hypothesis (BRH). Functional diversity was measured as Lalibert{\'{e}} and Legendre's functional dispersion (FDis), using leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf nitrogen and carbon contents, and proportions of water soluble compounds, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Correlations between FDis and deviations from BRH varied strongly, depending upon the combination of functional traits, the plant type or the environmental conditions, and the way in which prediction error was expressed (absolute or actual deviation). For tree species, FDis that was based on a combination of water soluble compounds, hemicellulose concentration, and LDMC was negatively correlated with interaction strength but positively with its absolute value. For herbs, interaction strength (absolute or actual) decreased as FDis of the mixtures increased, based on cellulose and lignin contents. There was no positive correlation between functional dispersion and the deviations from Grime's biomass-ratio hypothesis, with a null intercept. Despite a relation- ship between litter interactions and functional divergence, this relationship was not generalisable. Other functional traits that were missing in our study might have played an important role. Due},

abstract = {Green roofs provide multiple environmental and social benefits, among which the opportunity to control storm water runoff as they limit the rate of runoff after urbanization to the rate that would have occurred before urban development. The hydrological behaviour of a green roof is site specific, thus the local environmental parameters, the characteristics of the vegetation and the physical properties of its layers have to be considered in the evaluation of its performance. Furthermore, the hydrological performance of a green roof is influenced by the size of the plot (full-scale vs small scale), by the definition of “event”, and by the number of events included in the research. From this broader context this paper first provides a review of the scientific literature, with a focus on the hydrological behaviour of experimental full-scale installations and on hydrological modelling of green roof performance. Second, the study presents the results of a monitoring activity of a full-scale extensive green roof in Bologna (Italy). Continuous weather data and runoff were collected between January and December 2014, resulting in 69 storm events suitable for the study. Experimental data show that single event rainfall attenuation ranged from 6.4{\%} to 100{\%} with an annual average value of 51.9{\%} which is consistent with other author's findings. Last, the study uses the field data to calibrate and validate a numerical model realized with the commercial software SWMM 5.1. The model was used to simulate the long-term hydrologic response, over one year, of the same full-scale extensive green roof and to compare it to an adjacent impervious roof of the same size. Modelling results confirm the role of green roofs in restoring the natural water regime by reducing the annual runoff volume. The comparison of the results between the experimental green roof monitoring and the SWMM simulation proved that the suggested model has good capabilities in simulating the hydrograph of stormwater runoff from green roofs along the year, as demonstrated by the quite high values of NSE and the low value of RSR in both the calibration and validation phase. Furthermore, the low difference ({\textless} 9{\%}) in total retention between the 69 measured and simulated events confirms the suitability of the model for long term simulations. The proposed modelling approach demonstrates that SWMM can be used for assessing the performance of LID systems (Low Impact Development), and consequently for supporting local authorities or designers in the evaluation of the hydrological efficiency of green roofs.},

However, the mechanistic understanding of plant–soil feedbacks, as well as their roles in natural ecosystems in proportion to other possible drivers, is still in its infancy. Such knowledge will enhance our capacity to determine the contribution of plant–soil feedback to community and ecosystem responses under global environmental change.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Here, we review how plant–soil feedbacks may develop under extreme drought and precipitation events, CO2 and nitrogen enrichment, temperature increase, land use change and plant species loss vs. gain. We present a framework for opening the ‘black box of soil' considering the responses of the various biotic components (enemies, symbionts and decomposers) of plant–soil feedback to the global environmental changes, and we discuss how to integrate these components to understand and predict the net effects of plant–soil feedbacks under the various scenarios of change.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* To gain an understanding of how plant–soil feedback plays out in realistic settings, we also use the framework to discuss its interaction with other drivers of plant community composition, including competition, facilitation, herbivory, and soil physical and chemical properties.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* We conclude that understanding the role that plant–soil feedback plays in shaping the responses of plant community composition and ecosystem processes to global environmental changes requires unravelling the individual contributions of enemies, symbionts and decomposers. These biotic factors may show different response rates and strengths, thereby resulting in different net magnitudes and directions of plant–soil feedbacks under various scenarios of global change. We also need tests of plant–soil feedback under more realistic conditions to determine its contribution to changes in patterns and processes in the field, both at ecologically and evolutionary relevant time-scales.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Wetlands provide critical habitat for a diverse group of organisms and provide important ecosystem services. Despite this, most natural wetlands have been lost to anthropogenic activities, and as a result, wetland construction is common mitigation practice. Therefore, examination of constructed wetland viability in replacing the function of lost wetlands is vital. Our primary objectives were to compare amphibian communities of shallow and deep constructed wetlands to natural wetlands and to identify which wetland characteristics affect species composition. All wetlands were hydrologically isolated and fishless; natural wetlands had an ephemeral hydrology, and constructed wetland hydrology varied from ephemeral to permanent. Overall, constructed wetlands did not sufficiently replicate natural wetlands with respect to the amphibian community. However, two of our constructed wetlands had a drying period and exhibited communities more similar to natural wetlands. Hydroperiod and canopy closure were indicators of amphibian community composition. Many species observed in natural wetlands were rare in shallow constructed and absent in deep constructed wetlands. Additionally, dominant predator species (primarily Lithobates catesbeianus, Lithobates clamitans, and Notophthalmus viridescens) associated with permanent water were more abundant in constructed wetlands. Water depth, pH, and emergent vegetation were lower in natural wetlands. These data influenced land managers to revise construction methods and to renovate deep constructed wetlands by creating gradual slopes, decreasing maximum depth to 20 cm or less, maintaining canopy cover, and decreasing soil compaction to attempt replication of natural wetland hydrology.},

abstract = {Increasing plant species richness generally enhances plant biomass production, which may enhance accumulation of carbon (C) in soil. However, the net change in soil C also depends on the effect of plant diversity on C loss through decomposition of organic matter. Plant diversity can affect organic matter decomposition via changes in litter species diversity and composition, and via alteration of abiotic and/or biotic attributes of the soil (soil legacy effect). Previous studies examined the two effects on decomposition rates separately, and do therefore not elucidate the relative importance of the two effects, and their potential interaction. Here we separated the effects of litter mixing and litter identity from the soil legacy effect by conducting a factorial laboratory experiment where two fresh single root litters and their mixture were mixed with soils previously cultivated with single plant species or mixtures of two or four species. We found no evidence for litter-mixing effects. In contrast, root litter-induced CO2 production was greater in soils from high diversity plots than in soils from monocultures, regardless of the type of root litter added. Soil microbial PLFA biomass and composition at the onset of the experiment was unaffected by plant species richness, whereas soil potential nitrogen (N) mineralization rate increased with plant species richness. Our results indicate that the soil legacy effect may be explained by changes in soil N availability. There was no effect of plant species richness on decomposition of a recalcitrant substrate (compost). This suggests that the soil legacy effect predominantly acted on the decomposition of labile organic matter. We thus demonstrated that plant species richness enhances root litter-induced soil respiration via a soil legacy effect but not via a litter-mixing effect. This implies that the positive impacts of species richness on soil C sequestration may be weakened by accelerated organic matter decomposition.},

However, long-term field studies on the effects and mechanisms of tree species composition on N transformation are very limited. Eight years after tree seedlings were planted in a field experiment, we revisited the site and tested how tree species composition affects the dynamics of N mineralization and nitrification. Both tree species composition and season significantly influenced the soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON). N-fixing Acacia crassicarpa monoculture had the highest DON, and 10-mixed species plantation had the highest DOC. The lowest DOC and DON concentrations were both observed in Eucalyptus urophylla monoculture. The tree species composition also significantly affected net N mineralization rates. The highest rate of net N mineralization was found in A. crassicarpa monoculture, which was over twice than that in Castanopsis hystrix monoculture. The annual net N mineralization rates of 10-mixed and 30-mixed plantations were similar as that of N-fixing monoculture. Since mixed plantations have good performance in increasing soil DOC, DON, N mineralization and plant biodiversity, we recommend that mixed species plantations should be used as a sustainable approach for the restoration of degraded land in southern China.},

We developed a new measure for phylogenetic signal of binary traits, D, which simulations show gives robust results with data sets of more than 50 species, even when the proportion of threatened species is low. We applied D to the red-list status of British birds and the world's mammals and found that the threat status for both groups exhibited moderately strong phylogenetic clumping. We also tested the hypothesis that the phylogenetic pattern of species threatened by harvesting will be more strongly clumped than for those species threatened by either habitat loss or invasive species because the life-history traits mediating the effects of harvesting show strong evolutionary pattern. For mammals, our results supported our hypothesis; there was significant but weaker phylogenetic signal in the risk caused by the other two drivers (habitat loss and invasive species). We conclude that D is likely to be a useful measure of the strength of phylogenetic pattern in many binary traits.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are key organisms in the N cycle, as they control the first, rate-limiting step of the nitrification process. The question whether current environmental disturbances, such as climate warming and plant diversity losses, select for a particular community structure of AOB and/or influence their activity remains open. The purpose of this research was to study the impact of a 3 °C warming and of plant species richness (S) on microbial activity and diversity in synthesized grasslands, with emphasis on the nitrification process and on the diversity (community structure and richness) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). We measured soil chemical characteristics, basal respiration, potential nitrification and AOB diversity in soils under increasing plant species richness (S = 1, S = 3, S = 9) at ambient and (ambient +3 °C) temperature. Species were drawn from a 9-species pool, belonging to three functional groups: forbs, legumes and grasses. Mixtures comprised species from each of the three functional groups. Warming did not affect AOB diversity and increased potential nitrification at S = 3 only. Under warmed conditions, higher plant species richness resulted in increased potential nitrification rates. AOB richness increased with plant species richness. AOB community structure of monocultures under legumes differed from those under forbs and grasses. Clustering analysis revealed that AOB community structure under legume monocultures and mixtures of three and nine species grouped together. These results indicate that functional group identity rather than plant species richness influenced AOB community structure, especially through the presence of legumes. No clear relationship emerged between AOB richness and potential nitrification whatever plant species richness and temperature treatment. Our findings show a link between aboveground and belowground diversity, namely plant species richness, AOB richness and community structure. AOB richness was not related to soil processes, supporting the idea that increased diversity does not necessarily lead to increased rates of ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The importance of species richness for ecosystem productivity has received much attention in recent years, but the consequences of non-random species extinction remain poorly understood. We propose an index, 'essentiality', to assess the consequence of extinction of particular species for community biomass production. The essentiality of a species in a given community is the extent to which the functional role of that species is irreplaceable by the remaining species, calculated as the relative difference in yields between communities with and without the focal species. Species with zero essentiality play a completely replaceable functional role in their communities. Positive essentialities suggest irreplaceable contributions by species to their communities; species with essentiality values even higher than their dominance in the community may exhibit facilitative effects on the other species. Negative essentialities indicate interference of the focal species with other members of the same community. We applied this index to data from a microcosm experiment, in which five algal species were grown in monocultures and in all possible species combinations. Essentiality varied greatly across species. Two species had overall zero essentiality values throughout the experiment, two species had positive essentiality values which were lower than the species' dominance, and the remaining species had negative essentiality. Furthermore, two out of the five species had essentiality values dependent on species richness of communities from which they were lost; essentiality decreased with an increase in species richness. The essentiality index provides a straightforward measurement of functional consequences of individual species loss, which complements the existing analytical methods by focusing on the detection of facilitation and interference. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Plants can affect soil organic matter decomposition and mineralization through litter inputs, but also more directly through root-microbial interactions (rhizosphere effects). Depending on resource availability and plant species identity, these rhizosphere effects can be positive or negative. To date, studies of rhizosphere effects have been limited to plant species grown individually. It is unclear how belowground resources and inter-specific interactions among plants may influence rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition and plant N uptake. In this study, we tested the simple and interactive effects of plant diversity and water availability on rhizosphere-mediated soil C decomposition and plant N uptake. The study was conducted in the greenhouse with five semi-arid grassland species (monocultures and mixtures of all five species) and two water levels (15 and 20{\%} gravimetric soil moisture content). We hypothesized that microbial decomposition and N release would be less in the low compared to high water treatment and less in mixtures compared to monocultures. Rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition were both positive and negative among the five species when grown in monoculture, although negative effects prevailed by the end of the experiment. When grown in mixture, rhizosphere effects reduced soil C decomposition and plant N uptake compared to monocultures, but only at the low-water level. Our results suggest that when water availability is low, plant species complementarity and selection effects on water and N use can decrease soil C decomposition through rhizosphere effects. Although complementarity and selection effects can increase plant N uptake efficiency, plant N uptake in the mixtures was still lower than expected, most likely because rhizosphere effects reduced N supply in the mixtures more than in the monocultures. Our results indicate that rhizosphere effects on C and N cycling depend on water availability and inter-specific plant interactions. Negative rhizosphere effects on soil C decomposition and N supply in mixtures relative to monocultures of the component species could ultimately increase soil C storage and possibly influence how plant communities in semi-arid grasslands respond to global climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The effects of the grass species Lolium perenne L. and nine dicotyledonous grassland species, grown in monocultures and two-species mixtures, on (i) the soil microbial biomass, (ii) the respiration: biomass ratio and (iii) plant litter decomposition was investigated in a glasshouse experiment. 2. Microbial biomass was sometimes greater and sometimes less in the two-species mixtures than could be explained in terms of the additive effects of the two component species grown singly; this variation was independent of differences in below-ground plant productivity between monoculture and mixture treatments. 3. The microbial respiration: biomass ratios and plant litter decomposition rates in the two-species mixture treatments were either greater or less than expected based on the monoculture treatments; these differences were dependent on the combinations of species present. Because the respiration: biomass ratio is a measure of ecosystem stability, it is here proposed that stability does not respond predictably to shifts in species diversity. 4. These results provide evidence that increasing plant species richness (from one to two species) has the potential to influence soil processes positively or negatively in a non-additive way.

abstract = {Because of greater interest in green roofs in the United States, it is critical to increase the number and geographic range of proven plant resources for long-term survival on rooftops. Successful plant taxa for extensive green roofs must establish themselves quickly, provide high groundcover density, and tolerate extreme environ- mental conditions. Furthermore, dead load weight restrictions on many buildings may limit the substrate depth that can be applied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of substrate depth on initial establishment and survival of 25 succulent plant taxa for green roof applications in the midwestern United States. Survival, initial growth, and rate of coverage were compared for plants grown in three substrate depths (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 cm) on 24 roof platforms. Plant coverage was determined from image analysis of weekly digital photographs. Results indicate deeper substrates promote greater survival and growth; however, in the shallowest depth of 2.5 cm, several species continued to persist. Of the 25 species initially planted, only 47{\%} survived in the deepest substrate of 7.5 cm. Recommended species at the depths tested for climates similar to southern Michigan include Phedimus spurious Raf. ‘Leningrad White', Sedum acre L., S. album L. ‘Bella d'Inverno', S. middendorffianum L., S. reflexum L., S. sediforme J., and S. spurium Bieb. ‘Summer Glory'. Subsidiary species that are present at specific substrate depths but may not exhibit an ability to cover large areas include S. dasyphyllum L. ‘Burnatii', S. dasyphyllum L. ‘Lilac Mound', S. diffusum W., S. hispanicum L., and S. kamtschaticum Fisch. The primary deterrent for these subsidiary species was little to no survival at 2.5 cm. Deeper substrates promoted greater survival and growth for nearly all species tested.},

abstract = {Issue Title: IASWS 2011: The Interactions between Sediments and Water Bioturbation is a major process influencing the functioning of benthic ecosystems. Although controlled experiments with species in monoculture or in artificial combinations have increased the knowledge about the role of biological diversity on geochemical processes, specific interactions have been neglected, making the extrapolation of experimental results to natural systems difficult. In this context, the main objective of this study was to measure the effects of a whole natural macrobenthic community on benthic oxygen uptake. The relationships between macrofauna and oxygen uptakes were investigated in the estuarine system of the Seine, France, during the winter and fall according to the variability of river discharge. Four undisturbed sediment cores with associated macrofauna and overlying water were sampled at nine subtidal stations in order to perform whole core incubations and measure total oxygen uptake (TOU). Moreover, values of diffusive oxygen uptake (DOU) were obtained using microelectrode profiling and fauna-mediated oxygen uptake (FOU) was calculated as the difference between TOU and DOU. FOUs were thus linked to macrofaunal parameters; both traditional (species richness, abundance and biomass) and functional (trophic guilds and bioturbation modes). The average FOU (±SD) ranged from 170±36 to 1,324±701 $\mu$mol m{\^{}}sup -2{\^{}} h{\^{}}sup -1{\^{}}, and values represented 33 to 89 {\%} of TOU. Each of the traditional macrofauna parameters had a significant and positive correlation with FOU. In addition, abundance, biomass and species number of some functional groups (e.g. suspension feeders and biodiffusors) were also correlated to FOU, supporting the diversity-stability hypothesis of McArthur (Ecology 36:533-536, 1955). Nevertheless, the relationship between FOU and other functional groups such as conveyors illustrated the idiosyncratic nature of this hypothesis, underlining the difficulty of clearly identifying the role of a macrofaunal community on oxygen exchanges at the sediment-water interface. Our results confirm the importance of functional biodiversity on mineralization processes as well as the need to take into account the whole community. They also suggest that future studies should focus on the functional consequences of species loss and the potential resilience of the communities as a way to maintain ecosystem processes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {SummaryExperiments were conducted in the Patagonian steppe in southern South America to test the following hypotheses: (a) grasses take up most of the water from the upper layers of the soil and utilize frequent and short-duration pulses of water availability; (b) shrubs, on the contrary, take up most of the water from the lower layers of the soil and utilize infrequent and long-duration pulses of water availability. Grasses and shrubs were removed selectively and the performance of plants and the availability of soil resources were monitored. Results supported the overall hypothesis that grasses and shrubs in the Patagonian steppe use mainly different resources. Removal of shrubs did not alter grass production but removal of grasses resulted in a small increase in shrub production which was mediated by an increase in deep soil water and in shrub leaf water potential. The efficiency of utilization of resources freed by grass removal was approximately 25{\%}. Shrubs used water exclusively from lower soil layers. Grasses took up most of the water from upper layers but they were also capable of absorbing water from deep layers. This pattern of water partitioning along with the lack of response in leaf nitrogen to the removal treatments suggested that shrubs may be at a disadvantage to grasses with respect to nutrient capture and led to questions about the role of nutrient recirculation, leaching, and nitrogen fixation in the steppe.},

abstract = {Although urbanization is increasing worldwide, relatively few studies have investigated patterns of urban biodiversity outside of city parks and reserves, in urban neighborhoods where people live and work. We evaluated models including local and landscape factors that might influence the bee and butterfly richness of community gardens located within densely populated neighborhoods of the Bronx and East Harlem in New York City ({\textgreater}10,000 people/km2). The gardens were surrounded by buildings and limited amounts of green space (3,600–17,400 building units and 10–32{\%} green space within a 500 m radius). Contrary to our initial prediction that landscape green space might be especially influential in this heavily urbanized setting, the most highly supported models for both bee and butterfly richness (based on Akaike Information Criterion) included just the local, within-garden variables of garden floral area and sunlight availability. There was marginal support for models of bee richness including the number of building units surrounding gardens within a 500 m radius (which exhibited a negative association with bee richness). In addition, perhaps because bees are central place foragers that may nest within or near gardens, supported models of bee species richness also included total garden area, canopy cover, and the presence of wild/unmanaged area in the garden. Generally, our findings indicate that sunlight and floral abundance are the major factors limiting local pollinator diversity in this setting. This suggests that rooftop and other “open” urban habitats might be managed to increase local pollinator diversity, even if seemingly “isolated” within heavily developed neighborhoods.},

abstract = {Single-stage constructed wetlands (CWs) are characterized by a low potential for N removal. Understanding the pathways regulating N cycling as well as their dependence on environmental variables might improve the potential of CWs for N removal and results in more accurate simulation tools. In this study we employed qPCR targeting marker functional genes (amoA, nirK, nirS, clade I and II nosZ) or microorganisms (anammox) regulating key pathways of N cycling to unravel their relative importance. Furthermore, the influence of plant species on treatment performance was studied. Our findings indicated nitrification-denitrification as the principal route of N removal in CWs, while anammox did not have a strong contribution. Evidence was also arisen that ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) contributed on NH3oxidation. Overall, plant species had a weak effect on the abundance of N functional genes (amoA of AOA), but it strongly affected the performance of CWs in terms of N removal in the following order: unplanted {\textless} Phragmites communis {\textless} Typha latifolia. These findings suggest that plant species stimulate N removal by upregulating the rates that the responsible biochemical pathways operate, probably by increasing O2supply. In addition, our study revealed differences in indicators linked to N2O emissions. The abundance of clade II nosZ genes remained low across the season scaling down a strong contribution in the reduction of the emitted N2O. The increasing ratios of nosZ/$\sigma$nir and nirS/nirK with the progress of season indicate a shift in the composition of denitrifiers towards strains with a lower genetic potential for N2O release. Similar trends were observed among the treatments but the mechanisms differed. The planted treatments stimulated an increase in the $\sigma$nosZ/$\sigma$nir ratio, while the unplanted an increase in the nirS/nirK ratio.},

abstract = {Plant diversity can affect ecological processes such as competition and herbivory, and these ecological processes can act as drivers of evolutionary change. However, surprisingly little is known about how ecological variation in plant diversity can alter selective regimes on members of the community. Here, we examine how plant diversity at two different scales (genotypic and species diversity) impacts natural selection on a focal plant species, the common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis). Because competition is frequently relaxed in both genotypically and species rich plant communities, we hypothesized that increasing diversity would weaken selection on competitive ability. Changes in plant diversity can also affect associated arthropod communities. Therefore, we hypothesized that diversity would alter selection on plant traits mediating these interactions, such as herbivory related traits. We grew 24 focal O. biennis genotypes within four different neighbourhoods: genotypic monocultures or polycultures of O. biennis, and species monocultures or polycultures of old-field species that commonly co-occur with O. biennis. We then measured genotypic selection on nine plant traits known to be ecologically important for competition and herbivory. Focal O. biennis plants were smaller, flowered for shorter periods of time, had lower fitness, and experienced greater attack from specialist predispersal seed predators when grown with conspecifics versus heterospecifics. While neither conspecific nor heterospecific diversity altered trait means, both types of diversity altered the strength of selection on focal O. biennis plants. Specifically, selection on plant biomass was stronger in conspecific monocultures versus polycultures, but weaker in heterospecific monocultures versus polycultures. We found no evidence of selection on plant traits that mediate insect interactions, despite differences in arthropod communities on plants surrounded by conspecifics versus heterospecifics. Our data demonstrate that plant genotypic and species diversity can act as agents of natural selection, potentially driving evolutionary changes in plant communities.},

The foraging ranges for most bee species are unknown. Foraging distance information is critical for understanding the scale at which bee populations respond to the landscape, assessing the role of bee pollinators in affecting plant population structure, planning conservation strategies for plants, and designing bee habitat refugia that maintain pollination function for wild and crop plants. We used data from 96 records of 62 bee species to determine whether body size predicts foraging distance. We regressed maximum and typical foraging distances on body size and found highly significant and explanatory nonlinear relationships. We used a second data set to: (1) compare observed reports of foraging distance to the distances predicted by our regression equations and (2) assess the biases inherent to the different techniques that have been used to assess foraging distance. The equations we present can be used to predict foraging distances for many bee species, based on a simple measurement of body size.},

abstract = {Exotic-dominated ecosystems with low diversity are becoming increasingly common. It remains unclear, though, whether differences between native and exotic species (driver model), or changes in disturbances or resources (passenger model), allow exotics to become competitive dominants. In our field experiment, plant species origin (native or exotic), cattle grazing (ungrazed or intensely grazed once), and species composition treatments were fully crossed and randomly assigned to four-species mixtures and monocultures of grassland plants. We found that biodiversity declined more rapidly in exotic than in native species mixtures, regardless of our grazing disturbance treatment. Early declines in species evenness (i.e., increases in dominance) led to subsequent declines in species richness (i.e., local extinctions) in exotic mixtures. Specifically, Simpson's diversity was 29{\%} lower after 1 year, and species richness was 15{\%} lower after 3 years, in exotic than in native mixtures. These rapid biodiversity declines in exotic mixtures were partly explained by decreased complementarity (i.e., niche partitioning and facilitation), presumably because exotic species lack the coevolutionary history that can lead to complementarity and coexistence in native communities. Thus, our results suggest that exotic species can drive biodiversity declines in the presence or absence of a grazing disturbance, partly because exotic species interactions differ from native species interactions. This implies that restoring plant biodiversity in grasslands may require removal of exotic species, in addition to disturbance management},

abstract = {1. Fragmentation of natural habitats due to urban development is predicted to have negative impacts on species diversity. The surrounding landscape (or ‘matrix') of urban or semi-natural habitats can sometimes support biodiversity, but the amount of support will depend on species-specific traits, and on the resources available in the fragment and the matrix. 2. Using data on bees collected from 19 oak-savannah fragments, the question of whether bee communities differ when fragments are embedded in different landscapes (Douglas-fir forest vs. urban residential neighbourhoods) was investigated, and also whether these differences could be attributed to species-specific traits of bees (e.g. body size, specialization) and/or within-fragment floral resources. 3. No differences were found in overall richness or abundance of bees, but there were distinct differences in plant and bee community composition between matrix types. Common wood-nesters and late-flying, small-bodied bees tended to be found in urban-associated fragments, which also had a lower availability of within-fragment floral resources. 4. Forest-associated fragments, on the other hand, had a greater density and richness of early-flowering native plant species, and supported a higher abundance of large- bodied bee species. Bumble bee abundance, in particular, increased with increasing proportion of forest cover in the surrounding landscape. 5. Large-bodied bees appear to respond to increased availability of within-fragment floral resources, but it was also hypothesised that nesting and floral resources in matrix habitat drive the differences in bee community assemblages.},

abstract = {Heterospecific neighbors may reduce damage to a focal plant by lowering specialist herbivore loads (associational resistance hypothesis), or enhance damage by increasing generalist herbivore loads (associational susceptibility hypothesis). We tested the associational effects of tree diversity on herbivory patterns of the tropical focal tree Tabebuia rosea in an experimental plantation setup, which contained tree monocultures and mixed stands. We found higher herbivore damage to T. rosea at higher tree diversity, indicating that T. rosea did not benefit from associational resistance but rather experienced associational susceptibility. The specific consideration of the two dominant insect herbivore species of T. rosea, the specialist chrysomelid Walterianella inscripta and the specialist pyralid Eulepte gastralis, facilitated understanding of the detected damage patterns. Tree diversity exerted opposite effects on tree infestation by the two herbivores. These findings point to resource concentration effects for the chrysomelid beetle (favored by tree monoculture) and to resource dilution effects for the pyralid caterpillar (favored by tree mixture) as underlying mechanisms of herbivore distribution. A strong contribution of the pyralid to overall damage patterns in diversified stands suggests that associational susceptibility may not necessarily be related to higher abundances of generalist herbivores but may also result from specialized herbivores affected by resource dilution effects. Thus, the identity and biology of herbivore species has to be taken into account when attempting to predict damage patterns in forest ecosystems.},

We used data from a 12-year experiment to ask how plant species richness and composition influenced both observed and expected root depth distributions of plant communities. Expected root depth distributions were based on the abundance of species in each community and two traits of species that were measured in monocultures: root depth distributions and root-to-shoot ratios. The observed proportion of deep-root biomass increased more than expected with species richness and was positively correlated with aboveground productivity. Indeed, the proportion of deep-root biomass explained variation in productivity even after accounting for legume presence/abundance and greater nitrogen availability in diverse plots. Diverse plots had root depth distributions that were twice as deep as expected from their species composition and corresponding monoculture traits, partly due to interactions between C4 grasses and legumes. These results suggest that the productivity of diverse plant communities was partly dependent on belowground plant interactions that caused roots to be distributed more deeply in soil.},

abstract = {The reduction of insect herbivory is one of the services provided by tree diversity in forest ecosystems. While it is increasingly acknowledged that the compositional characteristics of tree species assemblages play a major role in triggering associational resistance to herbivores, underlying mechanisms are less well known. We addressed this question in the ORPHEE experiment by assessing pine processionary moth infestations (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) across a tree diversity gradient from pine monocultures to five species mixtures. We showed that tree species richness per se had no effect on the probability of attack by this pest. By contrast, the infestation rate was strongly dependent on plot composition. Mixtures of pines (Pinus pinaster) and birches (Betula pendula) were less prone to T. pityocampa infestations, whereas mixtures of pines and oaks (Quercus spp.) were more often attacked than pine monocultures. By taking into account the relative height of pines and associated broadleaved species, this effect could be explained by pine apparency. Pines were on average 343. ±. 5. cm height. Birches, as fast growing trees, were slightly taller than pines (363. ±. 6. cm), while oak trees were significantly smaller (74. ±. 1. cm). Host trees of T. pityocampa were then partly hidden in mixtures of pines and birches but more apparent in mixtures with oaks. We suggest that reduced pine apparency disrupted visual cues used by female moths to select host trees prior to oviposition. This study highlights the need to take into account tree traits such as growth rate when selecting the tree species that have to be associated in order to improve forest resistance to pest insects.},

abstract = {Plant diversity has been shown to influence the water cycle of forest ecosystems by differences in water consumption and the associated effects on groundwater recharge. However, the effects of biodiversity on soil water fluxes remain poorly understood for native tree species plantations in the tropics. Therefore, we estimated soil water fluxes and assessed the effects of tree species and diversity on these fluxes in an experimental native tree species plantation in Sardinilla (Panama). The study was conducted during the wet season 2008 on plots of monocultures and mixtures of three or six tree species. Rainfall and soil water content were measured and evapotranspiration was estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation. Soil water fluxes were estimated using a simple soil water budget model considering water input, output, and soil water and groundwater storage changes and in addition, were simulated using the physically based one-dimensional water flow model Hydrus-1D. In general, the Hydrus simulation did not reflect the observed pressure heads, in that modeled pressure heads were higher compared to measured ones. On the other hand, the results of the water balance equation (WBE) reproduced observed water use patterns well. In monocultures, the downward fluxes through the 200cm-depth plane were highest below Hura crepitans (6.13mmday-1) and lowest below Luehea seemannii (5.18mmday-1). The average seepage rate in monocultures (±SE) was 5.66±0.18mmday-1, and therefore, significantly higher than below six-species mixtures (5.49±0.04mmday-1) according to overyielding analyses. The three-species mixtures had an average seepage rate of 5.63±0.12mmday-1 and their values did not differ significantly from the average values of the corresponding species in monocultures. Seepage rates were driven by the transpiration of the varying biomass among the plots (r=0.61, p=0.017). Thus, a mixture of trees with different growth rates resulted in moderate seepage rates compared to monocultures of either fast growing or slow growing tree species. Our results demonstrate that tree-species specific biomass production and tree diversity are important controls of seepage rates in the Sardinilla plantation during the wet season. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. Although litter decomposition is a fundamental ecological process, most of our understanding comes from studies of single-species decay. Recently, litter-mixing studies have tested whether monoculture data can be applied to mixed-litter systems. These studies have mainly attempted to detect non-additive effects of litter mixing, which address potential consequences of random species loss – the focus is not on which species are lost, but the decline in diversity per se . 2. Under global change, species loss is likely to be non-random, with some species more vulnerable to extinction than others. Under such scenarios, the effects of individual species (additivity) as well as of species interactions (non-additivity) on decomposition rates are of interest. 3. To examine potential impacts of non-random species loss on ecosystems, we studied additive and non-additive effects of litter mixing on decomposition. A full-factorial litterbag experiment was conducted using four deciduous leaf species, from which mass loss and nitrogen content were measured. Data were analysed using a statistical approach that first looks for additive identity effects based on the presence or absence of species and then significant species interactions occurring beyond those. It partitions non-additive effects into those caused by richness and/or composition. 4. This approach addresses questions key to understanding the potential effects of species loss on ecosystem processes. If additive effects dominate, the consequences for decomposition dynamics will be predictable based on our knowledge of individual species, but not statistically predictable if non-additive effects dominate. 5. We found additive (identity) effects on mass loss and non-additive (composition) effects on litter nitrogen dynamics, suggesting that non-random species loss could significantly affect this system. We were able to identify the species responsible for effects that would otherwise have been considered idiosyncratic or absent when analysed by the methods used in previous work. 6. Synthesis . We observed both additive and non-additive effects of litter-mixing on decomposition, indicating consequences of non-random species loss. To predict the consequences of global change for ecosystem functioning, studies should examine the effects of both random and non-random species loss, which will help identify the mechanisms that influence the response of ecosystems to environmental change.},

abstract = {Urban greening solutions such as green roofs help improve residents' thermal comfort and building insulation. However, not all plants provide the same level of cooling. This is partially due to differences in plant structure and function, including different mechanisms that plants employ to regulate leaf temperature. Ranking of multiple leaf and plant traits involved in the regulation of leaf temperature (and, consequently, plants' cooling ‘service') is not well understood. We, therefore, investigated the relative importance of water loss, leaf colour, thickness and extent of pubescence for the regulation of leaf temperature, in the context of species for semi-extensive green roofs. Leaf temperature was measured with an infrared imaging camera in a range of contrasting genotypes within three plant genera (Heuchera, Salvia and Sempervivum). In three glasshouse experiments (each evaluating three or four genotypes of each genus),wevaried water availability to the plants and assessedhowleaf temperature altered depending on water loss and specific leaf traits. Greatest reductions in leaf temperature were closely associated with higher water loss. Additionally, in non-succulents (Heuchera, Salvia), lighter leaf colour and longer hair length (on pubescent leaves) both contributed to reduced leaf temperature. However, in succulent Sempervivum, colour and pubescence made no significant contribution; leaf thickness and rate of water loss were the key regulating factors. We propose that this can lead to different plant types having significantly different potentials for cooling. We suggest that maintaining transpirational water loss by sustainable irrigation and selecting urban plants with favourable morphological traits are the key to maximising thermal benefits provided by applications such as green roofs.

annote = {Background
- not all plants provide same level of cooling
- sedums aren't great for cooling
- don't know much aout how different plants regulate temperature and traits that underpin cooling
- certain leaf traits can influence heat flux
- leaf colour: defined by leaf hue, chroma and lightness
- leaf lightness: directly linked to its reflectance
- lighter leaf colour of a simiular hue increases short-wave reflectance and reduced leaf temperature
- leaf hair density may affect leaf convection and transpiration 
- increased leaf thickness may be linked to increased capacity for leaf heat storage, but slower dissipation --{\textgreater} increased leaf temepratures
- understanding importance of above-mentioned traits is important in plant selection for ecosystem service delivery
- selected evergreen perennials or subshrubs

Predictions
- less leaf stomatal conductance = increased leaf temperature
- light-coloured, thin leaves and/or longer leaf hairs have lower leaf temperatures

Method
- greenhouse experiment
- underwent watering regime (WW + DRY)
- water loss inferred by stomatal conductance
- leaf thickness was related to SLA + LDMC
- leaf colour was evaluated visually

Findings and implications
- leaf lightness, extent of pubescence, leaf thickness significantly affected leaf temperature
- higher stomatal conductance lead to lower leaf temperatures
- leaf lightness to temperature regulation was significant only among thin-leaved non-succulent genera
- leaf thickness was only important for leaf temperature differences in succulent genotypes; thick leaves store more heat
- different plant genera may depend on different traits to effectively regular temperature of their leaves},

abstract = {The larger aquatic plants growing in wetlands are usually called macrophytes. These include aquatic vascular plants, aquatic mosses and some larger algae. The presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes is one of the characteristics used to define wetlands, and as such macrophytes are an indispensable component of these ecosystems. As the most important removal processes in constructed treatment wetlands are based on physical and microbial processes, the role of the macrophytes in these has been questioned. This paper summarizes how macrophytes influence the treatment processes in wetlands. The most important functions of the macrophytes in relation to the treatment of wastewater are the physical effects the presence of the plants gives rise to. The macrophytes stabilise the surface of the beds, provide good conditions for physical filtration, prevent vertical flow systems from clogging, insulate the surface against frost during winter, and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth. Contrary to earlier belief, the growth of macrophytes does not increase the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate in soil-based subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The metabolism of the macrophytes affects the treatment processes to different extents depending on the type of the constructed wetland. Plant uptake of nutrients is only of quantitative importance in low-loaded systems (surface flow systems). Macrophyte mediated transfer of oxygen to the rhizosphere by leakage from roots increases aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitrification. The macrophytes have additional site-specific values by providing habitat for wildlife and making wastewater treatment systems aesthetically pleasing. (C) 1997 IAWQ},

abstract = {Numerous studies have reported positive effects of species richness on plant community productivity. Such biodiversity effects are usually quantified by comparing the performance of plant mixtures with reference monocultures. However, several mechanisms, such as the lack of resource complementarity and facilitation or the accumulation of detrimental agents, suggest that monocultures are more likely than mixtures to deteriorate over time. Increasing biodiversity effects over time could therefore result from declining monocultures instead of reflecting increases in the functioning of mixtures. Commonly, the latter is assumed when positive trends in biodiversity effects occur. Here, we analysed the performance of 60 grassland species growing in monocultures and mixtures over 9 years in a biodiversity experiment to clarify whether their temporal biomass dynamics differed and whether a potential decline of monocultures contributed significantly to the positive net biodiversity effect observed. Surprisingly, individual species' populations produced, on average, significantly more biomass per unit area when growing in monoculture than when growing in mixture. Over time, productivity of species decreased at a rate that was, on average, slightly more negative in monocultures than in mixtures. The mean net biodiversity effect across all mixtures was continuously positive and ranged between 64-217 g per m(2). Short-term increases in the mean net biodiversity effect were only partly due to deteriorating monocultures and were strongly affected by particular species gaining dominance in mixtures in the respective years. We conclude that our species performed, on average, comparably in monocultures and mixtures; monoculture populations being slightly more productive than mixture populations but this trend decreased over time. This suggested that negative feedbacks had not yet affected monocultures strongly but could potentially become more evident in the future. Positive biodiversity effects on aboveground productivity were heavily driven by a small, but changing, set of species that behaved differently from the average species.},

abstract = {A mesocosm experiment with monocultures and mixtures of five common extensive green roof plant species was performed to study water retention, wash-out of solids and thermal behavior over 24 months. Plants were grown as equal-sized plug plants at the same density in a typical system configuration consisting of a standard substrate, a system filter and a drainage element. At the study site, both summers proved to be hotter ({\textgreater}2 °C) and drier than the long-term averages, creating severe drought stress in all the species and most probably being representative of future summers under climatic change in Southern Germany. While the mini-shrub Thymus serpyllum died off in the first season in the monocultures but not in the mixtures, most individuals of the herb Dianthus carthusianorum and the legume Lotus corniculatus died during the second season. Later on, the grass Koeleria glauca turned senescent as well and only the succulent Phedimus floriferus cv. “Weihenstephaner Gold” (=Sedum kamtschaticum var. floriferum), was able to stay alive in all of the combinations until the end of the experiment. 13C isotopic analyses confirmed that despite the severe drought the sedum used the C3-instead of the CAM-photosynthetic pathway. As shown by continuous measurements of substrate temperatures and infrared thermometry, the species turned out to have the highest and longest cooling potential out of the tested species. Overall, vegetation cover and shoot mass affected substrate cooling and water retention. Water capture was highest in the legume Lotus corniculatus and the grass Koeleria glauca, while water use efficiency and dry mass accumulation were highest in P. floriferus (312 g m−2 per year). However, the combination of the succulent with the N-fixing legume L. corniculatus yielded 37{\%} more dry shoot mass and a higher vegetation cover. During the whole period, water retention of the bare substrate amounted to 29{\%} of the precipitation volume leaving 366 mm of water for evaporation. Planted mesocoms retained on average 40{\%} (i.e. 506 mm) of the rainfall that could be used for evapotranspiration. Wash-out of solids from the bare substrate amounted to 394 g m−2, but was not significantly higher than the loss of substrate from planted mesocosms. Under the extreme climatic conditions in present study, plant mixtures were not superior to monocultures in terms of cooling potentials, water retention and wash-out, but plant survivorship and maintenance of a high vegetation cover proved to be the main drivers of these services.},

abstract = {Higher plant diversity is often associated with higher soil microbial biomass and diversity, which is assumed to be partly due to elevated root exudate diversity. However, there is little experimental evidence that diversity of root exudates shapes soil microbial communities. We tested whether higher root exudate diversity enhances soil microbial biomass and diversity in a plant diversity gradient, thereby negating significant plant diversity effects on soil microbial properties. We set up plant monocultures and two- and three-species mixtures in microcosms using functionally dissimilar plants and soil of a grassland biodiversity experiment in Germany. Artificial exudate cocktails were added by combining the most common sugars, organic acids, and amino acids found in root exudates. We applied four different exudate cocktails: two exudate diversity levels (low- and high-diversity) and two nutrient-enriched levels (carbon- and nitrogen-enriched), and a control with water only. Soil microorganisms were more carbon- than nitrogen-limited. Cultivation-independent fingerprinting analysis revealed significantly different soil microbial communities among exudate diversity treatments. Most notably and according to our hypothesis, adding diverse exudate cocktails negated the significant plant diversity effect on soil microbial properties. Our findings provide the first experimental evidence that root exudate diversity is a crucial link between plant diversity and soil microorganisms.},

abstract = {Interactions between aboveground and belowground biota have the potential to modify ecosystem responses to climate change, yet little is known about how drought influences plant–soil feedbacks with respect to microbial mediation of plant community dynamics. ? We tested the hypothesis that drought modifies plant–soil feedback with consequences for plant competition. We measured net pairwise plant–soil feedbacks for two grassland plant species grown in monoculture and competition in soils that had or had not been subjected to a previous drought; these were then exposed to a subsequent drought. To investigate the mechanisms involved, we assessed treatment responses of soil microbial communities and nutrient availability. ? We found that previous drought had a legacy effect on bacterial and fungal community composition that decreased plant growth in conspecific soils and had knock-on effects for plant competitive interactions. Moreover, plant and microbial responses to subsequent drought were dependent on a legacy effect of the previous drought on plant–soil interactions. ? We show that drought has lasting effects on belowground communities with consequences for plant–soil feedbacks and plant–plant interactions. This suggests that drought, which is pre- dicted to increase in frequency with climate change, may change soil functioning and plant community composition via the modification of plant–soil feedbacks.

abstract = {Bioturbation processes of a dense ophiuroid assemblage were studied by in situ time-lapse sediment-profile imagery (t-SPI) and laboratory tracer-experiments. The burrows of 4 Amphiura fliformis (Ophiuroida) individuals were visible throughout the t-SPI deployment. Mean burrow excavation was 2.9 cm(2) h(-1). Mounding ranged from 0 to 7.12 m(2) h(-1). Loss of sediment from the sediment-water interface ranged from 0 to 7.0 cm(2) h(-1). Bioturbation at the station was dominated by A. filiformis, whose presence appeared to mask the activity of conspecifics. Species interactions were investigated in terms of particle reworking by laboratory luminophore-tracer experiments of monocultures and species mixtures using A. filiformis, Leptopentacta elongata (Holothuroida) and Nephtys hombergii (Polychaeta). Bioturbation by these large species fit a symmetric non-local model well. Species interactions led to underyielding with respect to predicted additive species-effects. Treatments containing A. filiformis were significantly different from treatments without A. filiformis, and not significantly different from each other. When the data was processed on a per capita basis, multiculture treatments containing N. hombergii underyielded due to the high biomass of N. hombergii and its relatively low bioturbation activity. Ordination of a distance matrix derived from tracer profiles showed that tracer profiles produced by multispecies treatments were most similar to the strongest bioturbator, due to destruction of conspecific structures by the strongest bioturbator. Species interactions are not additive in terms of particle bioturbation, and may be difficult to predict without knowing in situ densities.},

abstract = {In urban environments, green roofs provide a number of benefits, including decreased urban heat island effects and reduced energy costs for buildings. However, little research has been done on the non-plant biota associated with green roofs, which likely affect their functionality. For the current study, we evaluated whether or not green roofs planted with two native plant communities in New York City functioned as habitats for soil fungal communities, and compared fungal communities in green roof growing media to soil microbial composition in five city parks, including Central Park and the High Line. Ten replicate roofs were sampled one year after planting; three of these roofs were more intensively sampled and compared to nearby city parks. Using Illumina sequencing of the fungal ITS region we found that green roofs supported a diverse fungal community, with numerous taxa belonging to fungal groups capable of surviving in disturbed and polluted habitats. Across roofs, there was significant biogeographical clustering of fungal communities, indicating that community assembly of roof microbes across the greater New York City area is locally variable. Green roof fungal communities were compositionally distinct from city parks and only 54{\%} of the green roof taxa were also found in the park soils. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis revealed that park soils had greater microbial biomass and higher bacterial to fungal ratios than green roof substrates. City park soils were also more enriched with heavy metals, had lower pH, and lower quantities of total bases (Ca, K, and Mg) compared to green roof substrates. While fungal communities were compositionally distinct across green roofs, they did not differentiate by plant community. Together, these results suggest that fungi living in the growing medium of green roofs may be an underestimated component of these biotic systems functioning to support some of the valued ecological services of green roofs.},

abstract = {Plant diversity is a key driver of ecosystem functioning best documented for its influence on plant productivity. The strength and direction of plant diversity effects on species interactions across trophic levels are less clear. For example, with respect to the interactions between herbivorous invertebrates and plants, a number of competing hypotheses have been proposed that predict either increasing or decreasing community herbivory with increasing plant species richness. We investigated foliar herbivory rates and consumed leaf biomass along an experimental grassland plant diversity gradient in year eight after establishment. The gradient ranged from one to 60 plant species and manipulated also functional group richness (from one to four functional groups-legumes, grasses, small herbs, and tall herbs) and plant community composition. Measurements in monocultures of each plant species showed that functional groups differed in the quantity and quality of herbivory damage they experienced, with legumes being more damaged than grasses or non-legume herbs. In mixed plant communities, herbivory increased with plant diversity and the presence of two key plant functional groups in mixtures had a positive (legumes) and a negative (grasses) effect on levels of herbivory. Further, plant community biomass had a strong positive impact on consumed leaf biomass, but little effect on herbivory rates. Our results contribute detailed data from a well-established biodiversity experiment to a growing body of evidence suggesting that an increase of herbivory with increasing plant diversity is the rule rather than an exception. Considering documented effects of herbivory on other ecosystem functions and the increase of herbivory with plant diversity, levels of herbivory damage might not only be a result, but also a trigger within the diversity-productivity relationship.},

Seagrass systems provide some of the best evidence for the ecological effects of genetic diversity among adult shoots, but we do not know if the genetic diversity of seeds and seedlings also influences seagrass ecology. We tested the effects of seagrass (Zostera marina) seed diversity and relatedness on germination success, seedling morphology, and seedling production by comparing experimental assemblages of seeds collected from single reproductive shoots (“monocultures”) to assemblages of seeds collected from multiple reproductive shoots (“polycultures”). There was no difference in seedling emergence, yet seedlings from polycultures had larger shoots above and below ground than seedlings from monocultures at the end of the 1-yr experiment. Genetic relatedness of the seedlings predicted some aspects of shoot morphology, with more leaves and longer roots and shoots at intermediate levels of relatedness, regardless of seed diversity. Our results suggest that studies of only adult stages may underestimate the importance of genetic diversity if the benefits at early life history stages continue to accrue throughout the life cycle.},

abstract = {With the aim to develop an approach for treating wastewater with low carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio in constructed wetlands (CWs), we compared the effects of C addition and species diversity on N removal and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Compared with the monocultures without C addition, C addition significantly increased N removal efficiency in monocultures (reached 71{\%} on average); increasing species richness impacted N removal as much as C addition, and the N removal efficiency in the four-species mixture reached 75{\%}. Both C addition and increasing species richness level significantly increased N2O emission rates (reached 1.26 and 1.40 mg m-2d-1, respectively), but had no significant effect on N2O emissions per unit N removal. The effects of species richness on N removal and N2O emissions were stronger than species identity. Compared with C addition, assembling plant communities with high diversity in actual applications could be an effective and more economical approach for treating wastewater with low C/N ratio in CWs.},

abstract = {* Negative plant–soil feedback occurs when the presence of an individual of a particular species at a particular site decreases the relative success of individuals of the same species compared with those other species at that site. This effect favours heterospecifics thereby facilitating coexistence and maintaining diversity. Empirical work has demonstrated that the average strengths of these feedbacks correlate with the relative abundance of species within a community, suggesting that feedbacks are an important driver of plant community composition. Understanding what factors contribute to the generation of this relationship is necessary for diagnosing the dynamic forces that maintain diversity in plant communities. * We used a spatially explicit, individual-based computer simulation to test the effects of dispersal distance, the size of feedback neighbourhoods, the strength of pairwise feedbacks and community wide variation of feedbacks, community richness, as well as life-history differences on the dependence of relative abundance on strength of feedback. * We found a positive dependence of relative abundance of a species on its average feedback for local scale dispersal and feedback. However, we found that the strength of this dependence decreased as either the spatial scale of dispersal and/or the spatial scale of feedback increased. We also found that for spatially local (i.e. relatively small) scale interaction and dispersal, as the mean strength of feedbacks in the community becomes less negative, the greater the increase in abundance produced by a comparable increase in species-specific average feedback. We found that life-history differences such as mortality rate did not generate a pattern with abundance, nor did they affect the relationship between abundance and average feedback. * Synthesis. Our results support the claim that empirical observations of a positive correlation between relative abundance and strength of average feedback serve as evidence that local scale negative feedbacks play a prominent role in structuring plant communities. We also identify that this relationship depends upon local scale plant dispersal and feedback which generates clumping and magnifies the negative feedbacks.},

abstract = {Impaired natural ecosystems, such as agricultural lands, are restored toward original or other target stage. Because the long agricultural history has changed the physical, chemical and biological features of the soil, afforested fields can harbor novel species assemblages and interactions. Our overall aim was to quantify the diversity of ground beetles and ants in early successional afforested fields. In a large scale field experiment, we compared plots that had been afforested 25. years ago by planting monocultures of birch, pine or spruce trees. A total of 4080 carabid individuals representing 41 species, and 131,933 ant individuals representing 15 species were recorded. Both the carabid and ant assemblage included forest and open-habitat species, but were dominated by generalists, which is typical for early successional habitats. Tree species had a strong influence on carabid and ant assemblages. Species composition among pine plots was more homogeneous than among spruce or birch plots. The diversity of ground beetles and ants increased from pine to spruce to birch plots, most likely due to positive influence of leaf litter. Our results indicate that early successional afforested fields can harbor species rich arthropod assemblages. The diversity and species composition of these assemblages are influenced by tree species, already at early successional stages, and are likely to become more prominent as succession proceeds. Thus, the tree species used in afforestation is one important factor for consideration, if field afforestation has biodiversity objectives.},

abstract = {Traditional construction practices provide little opportunity for environmental remediation to occur in urban areas. As concerns for environmental improvement in urban areas become more prevalent, innovative practices which create ecosystem services and ecologically functional land cover in cities will be in higher demand. Green roofs are a prime example of one of these practices. The past decade has seen the North American green roof industry rapidly expand through international green roof conferences, demonstration sites, case studies, and scientific research. This study evaluates existing international and North American green roof policies at the federal, municipal, and community levels. Green roof policies fall into a number of general categories, including direct and indirect regulation, direct and indirect financial incentives, and funding of demonstration or research projects. Advantages and disadvantages of each category are discussed. Salient features and a list of prompting standards common to successfully implemented green roof strategies are then distilled from these existing policies. By combining these features with data collected from an experimental green roof site in Athens, Georgia, the planning and regulatory framework for widespread green roof infrastructure can be developed. The authors propose policy instruments be multi-faceted and spatially focused, and also propose the following recommendations: (1) Identification of green roof overlay zones with specifications for green roofs built in these zones. This spatial analysis is important for prioritizing areas of the jurisdiction where green roofs will most efficiently function; (2) Offer financial incentives in the form of density credits and stormwater utility fee credits to help overcome the barriers to entry of the new technology; (3) Construct demonstration projects and institutionalize a commitment greening roofs on publicly-owned buildings as an effective way of establishing an educated roofing industry and experienced installers for future green roof construction.},
annote = {- federal incentives to promote green roofs
(1) US - FWPCA or CWA acts
(2) US - LEED certification for all new projects
(reach LEED silver standards; up to 15 pts)
(3) US - Environmental Protection Agency (partnership with environmental groups)

- municipal incentives to promote green roofs
(1) technology standards - Portland, TO, Tokyo
(build green roofs based on min sq footage)
(2) performance standards
(BAF targets, minimum reflectivity standard)
(3) direct financial incentives
(subsidies as {\$}/m2)
(4) indirect financial incentives
(credit programs to offet fees)

- little political footing for green roof initiatives if the following aren't met:
(1) stormwater runoff
(2) thermal impacts
(3) lack of greenspace or biodiversity

- green roof policies are most effective where:
(1) high drainage basin
(2) dense populations
(3) can use GIS to find out optimal areas
- large advocacy group: non-profit GRHC
- individuals play a curcial role as well! 

Application of Green Roof Policy
test case: Athens, GA
- land-use: lots of grey space, bustlin' urban area,
- used green roof test plot at university

Built Infrastructure 
- stormwater system distinct from sanitary sewer

Regulatory Infrastructure 
- committee wants a stormwater utility (quanity, quality and base fee)
- currently, construction fees doesn't have to follow environemntally friendly practices
- limits to floor area ratio depending on zoning class (maximum FAR is 5.0)

Policy Recommendations
- important for political body to clearly define goals it wants to accomplish
- urban greening initiatives may be defined for green corridors, but not green construction
- most effective green roof polocy in ACC: spatially focused + multifaceted; spatial tarets are govenrment, commercial and industrial
- good criteria for green roof construction
(1) flat roofs are eligible for credit programs
(2) min thickness of growing medium: 3 inches
(3) vegetative, growing media + specialized roofing layers must be installed according to manufacturer specifications
(4) green roof mainenance plan must be submitted
(5) modules: a min area of 50{\%} must be greened for roofs to qualify for credit programs

Technology Standards
- mandate roof greening in public building is recommended
- positive ecosystem services from green roof plants

Indirect Financial Incentives
- recommends stormwater utility credit for green roof installation
- GSMM currenty does not reference green roofs as a stormwater volume mitigation tool
- allowing green roofs to count towards the stormwater volume credit (independent of GSMM) may be an easier task
- analysis of runoff data collected at green roof site == water quantity credit == 1.78/mo
- floor area bonuses; a form of density credits when green roof are installed in the green roof district overlays

Discussion and conclusion
- finding ways to repair damaged environment in urban landscape is hard
- more tools for practitioners == more flexibility
- different policies at different governmental levels
- policy effects are difficult to track},

abstract = {Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) have gained attention for their role in plant community dynamics, but their role in productivity has been overlooked. We developed and tested a biomass-specific, multi-species model to examine the role of PSFs in diversity-productivity relationships. The model predicts a negative relationship between PSFs and overyielding: plants with negative PSFs grow more in communities than in monoculture (i.e. overyield), and plants with positive PSFs grow less in communities than in monoculture (i.e. underyield). This effect is predicted to increase with diversity and saturate at low species richness because the proportion of 'self-cultivated' soils rapidly decreases as species are added to a community. Results in a set of glasshouse experiments supported model predictions. We found that PSFs measured in one experiment were negatively correlated with overyielding in three-species plant communities measured in a separate experiment. Furthermore, when parametrized with our experimental PSF data, our model successfully predicted species-level overyielding and underyielding. The model was less effective at predicting community-level overyielding and underyielding, although this appeared to reflect large differences between communities with or without nitrogen-fixing plants. Results provide conceptual and experimental support for the role of PSFs in diversity-productivity relationships.},

abstract = {Species loss and invasion of exotic species are two components of global biodiversity change that are expected to influence ecosystem functioning. Yet how they interact in natural settings remains unclear. Experiments have revealed two major mechanisms for the observed increase in primary productivity with plant species richness. Plant productivity may rise with species richness due to the increased amount of resources used by more diverse communities (niche complementarity) or through the increased probability of including a highly productive, dominant species in the community (sampling effect). Current evidence suggests that niche complementarity is the most relevant mechanism, whereas the sampling effect would only play a minor and transient role in natural systems. In turn, exotic species can invade by using untapped resources or because they possess a fitness advantage over resident species allowing them to dominate the community. We argue that the sampling effect can be a significant biodiversity mechanism in ecosystems invaded by dominant exotic species, and that the effect can be persistent even after decades of succession. We illustrate this idea by analyzing tree species richness–productivity relationships in a subtropical montane forest (NW Argentina) heavily invaded by Ligustrum lucidum, an evergreen tree from Asia. We found that the forest biomass increased along a natural gradient of tree species richness whether invaded by L. lucidum or not. Consistent with the sampling effect, L. lucidum invasion tripled total tree biomass irrespective of species richness, and monocultures of L. lucidum were more productive than any of the most species-rich, uninvaded communities. Hence, the sampling effect may not be restricted to randomly assembled, synthetic communities. We emphasize that studying invaded ecosystems may provide novel insights on the mechanisms underlying the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function.},

abstract = {The importance of herbivores and of plant diversity for community succession and recovery from disturbance is well documented. However, few studies have assessed the relative magnitude of, or potential interactions between, these factors. To determine the combined effect of herbivory and surrounding algal species richness on the recovery of a rocky intertidal community, we conducted a 27-month field experiment assessing algal recruitment and succession in cleared patches that mimic naturally forming gaps in the ambient community. We crossed two herbivore treatments, ambient and reduced abundance, with monocultures and polycultures of the four most common algal species in a mid-high rocky intertidal zone of northern California. We found that both the presence of herbivores and high surrounding algal richness increased recovery rates, and the effect of algal richness was twice the magnitude of that of herbivores. The increased recovery rate of patches containing herbivores was due to the consumption of fast-growing, early colonist species that preempt space from perennial, late-successional species. Mechanisms linking algal richness and recovery are more numerous. In polycultures, herbivore abundance and species composition is altered, desiccation rates are lower, and propagule recruitment, survival, and growth are higher compared to monocultures, all of which could contribute the observed effect of surrounding species richness. Herbivory and species richness should jointly accelerate recovery wherever palatable species inhibit late-successional, herbivore-resistant species and recruitment and survival of new colonists is promoted by local species richness. These appear to be common features of rocky-shore seaweed, and perhaps other, communities.},

abstract = {Soil respiration is an important pathway of the C cycle. However, it is still poorly understood how changes in plant community diversity can affect this ecosystem process. Here we used a long-term experiment consisting of a gradient of grassland plant species richness to test for effects of diversity on soil respiration. We hypothesized that plant diversity could affect soil respiration in two ways. On the one hand, more diverse plant communities have been shown to promote plant productivity, which could increase soil respiration. On the other hand, the nutrient concentration in the biomass produced has been shown to decrease with diversity, which could counteract the production-induced increase in soil respiration. Our results clearly show that soil respiration increased with species richness. Detailed analysis revealed that this effect was not due to differences in species composition. In general, soil respiration in mixtures was higher than would be expected from the monocultures. Path analysis revealed that species richness predominantly regulates soil respiration through changes in productivity. No evidence supporting the hypothesized negative effect of lower N concentration on soil respiration was found. We conclude that shifts in productivity are the main mechanism by which changes in plant diversity may affect soil respiration},

abstract = {Five tropical treatment wetlands dominated by floating aquatic plants and constructed to deal with a variety of wastewaters were compared for their effectiveness in treating organic matter and nutrients in the Parismina River Basin in eastern Costa Rica. Wastewaters were from a dairy farm, a dairy processing plant, a banana paper plant, and a landfill. Four of the five wetland systems were effective in reducing nutrient levels of effluents before water was discharged into rivers. Ammonia levels in water entering most wetlands were considerably higher than ambient (i.e., riverine) levels; concentrations were reduced by as much as 92{\%} in the wetlands and retained at a maximum rate of 166 g N m-2year-1. Nitrate nitrogen removal was variable, but occurred in low concentrations in the inflows (less than 1 mg N L-1). Phosphate phosphorus was present in high levels but was effectively reduced through the wetlands (92 and 45{\%} reductions through dairy farm wetlands, 83{\%} reduction through banana paper wetlands, and 80{\%} reduction through dairy processing wetlands). Retention of phosphate phosphorus ranged from 0.1 to 10.7 g P m-2year-1in the treatment wetlands. Dissolved oxygen in the wetland outflows were ≤2 mg L-1in three of the sampled wetlands, most likely a result of the abundant free-floating macrophytes that sheltered the water from diffusion and shaded aquatic productivity. The efficacy of these created wetlands to treat effluents from different sources varied, and modified wetland designs or active management may be necessary to improve water quality even further. Recommendations on tropical wetland design and management are presented, as are suggestions for implementing this ecological engineering approach with farmers in Central America. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Green infrastructure is a strategic network of green spaces designed to deliver ecosystem services to human communities. Green infrastructure is a convenient concept for urban policy makers, but the term is used too generically and with limited understanding of the relative values or benefits of different types of green space and how these complement one another. At a finer scale/more practical level, little consideration is given to the composition of the plant communities, yet this is what ultimately defines the extent of service provision. This paper calls for greater attention to be paid to urban plantings with respect to ecosystem service delivery and for plant science to engage more fully in identifying those plants that promote various services. SCOPE: Many urban plantings are designed based on aesthetics alone, with limited thought on how plant choice/composition provides other ecosystem services. Research is beginning to demonstrate, however, that landscape plants provide a range of important services, such as helping mitigate floods and alleviating heat islands, but that not all species are equally effective. The paper reviews a number of important services and demonstrates how genotype choice radically affects service delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Although research is in its infancy, data are being generated that relate plant traits to specific services, thereby helping identify genotypes that optimize service delivery. The urban environment, however, will become exceedingly bland if future planting is simply restricted to monocultures of a few 'functional' genotypes. Therefore, further information is required on how to design plant communities where the plants identified (1) provide more than a single benefit (multifunctionality), (B) complement each other in maximizing the range of benefits that can be delivered in one location, and (3) continue to maintain public acceptance through diversity. The identification/development of functional landscape plants is an exciting and potentially high-impact arena for plant science.},
annote = {Introduction
- lack of specific plant species in current green roof policies
- issue: plant selection has to provide both wider human needs and tolerance to urban enviornments
- using plant traits and genotypes may improve plant selection process
- important in understanding ES provision from popular cultivars (genotypes)
- large focus on street trees and green roofs 

Urban biodiversity
- cultivars may differ in terms of insect visitation 

Rooftop cooling
- multiple mechanisms of how vegetation can provide rooftop cooling (1) shade, (2) evaporatranspiration, (3) thermal to chemical energy, (4) albedo 
- extent of cooling altered by traits such as LAI SLA, stomatal conductance, leaf colour 
- sedums aren't best species to optimize rooftop cooling; species with light-colour non-succulent leaf canopies were more superior
- species that cool via shade: attain multiple layers of leaves
- species that cool via evapotranspiration: provide single layer of evenly spaced leaves 

Energy conservation
- plants can insulate buildings during winter
- shelter from plant trees reduced water energy consumption

Storm-water retention
- water retention was improved by grasses and forbs rather than succulents (based on structural differences)
- ability to recharge storage capacity is important as well (high transpiration rates)

Mitigate soil, aerial + H2O pollutants
- grasses were more effective at particular matter than broad-leaved or succulents, due to complex canopy structures + possessing parallel grooves on their leaes 
- root mass is important for reducint pollutant runoff

Human health and well-being
- alleviate stress + encourage physical activity
- plant-derived volatile chemicals to enhance immune functioning??
- landscape quality influences restoration potential
- phenology plays a big role
- humans have preferences for certain plant forms (flat-topped specimen)

Noise mitigation
- plants can absorb, diffuse + deflect noise
- dense foliage, low forking branches, large leaf size, large branching characteristics

Crime and security 
- regreening urban areas lead to reduction in robbery, burglary, theft and shooting
- tradeoff: plantings can conceal criminals. but can circument this using thorns of sharp serrations

Education and cultural opportunities
- provides connection to nature
- highest engagement can occur in urban centres

Disservices
- some species provide disservices
- some plants attract unwanted insect species
- trees with large amounts of leaf litter are best avoied in pedestrian presincts
- trees with high sugar secretions are not apopriate within car parks 

Multiple benefits
- certain species are better than others in promoting multipe services
- for example, salvia offinalis and stachys byzantina provide rooftop cooling, stormwater retention, increase storage capacity, habitat provision, traps aerial pollutants and provides pollen for honey bees

What Next?
- practitioners tend to perceive plant selection as either what survives well or what looks pretty
- need to chance policymakers' perspective to only "why" plant selection is importamt, but to how "how" and "where" for effective management
- a change in philosophy from "what will survive" to "what provides function". 
- urban design is poor if monocultures are only used},

abstract = {Green roofs provide many ecosystem services such as regulation of building temperatures, reducing urban heat-island effects and draining rainwater. In addition, they are expected to reduce the high levels of CO2concentrations in big cities. Previous CO2fixation studies on green roofs were done by taking long-time-period samples using expensive equipment and with limited replication. To plan green roofs for optimal CO2reduction, a simple method to quantify CO2fixation rate in relation to plant species-composition is required. The method we tested is direct measurement of CO2concentrations with a portable air-quality meter, which allows a large number of samples. Here we focus on differences in the photosynthetic effect between plots containing the local Mediterranean succulent, Sedum sediforme and plots containing various annuals. In a factorial design (presence or absence of Sedum crossed with presence or absence of annuals), we tested the effect of sedum and annual treatments on CO2concentrations. To compare our results with a commonly used method, and to evaluate the role of the different species, we examined the photosynthetic activity at the single plant level under these treatments by using a portable gas-exchange measuring system. We found that our method can detect the effect of different green roof plots and can be used as a simple and reliable tool for green-roof planers. We found that annuals reduced CO2concentrations, but only in the absence of Sedum. Sedum alone had no effect on CO2concentrations. This emphasizes the importance of integrating plots with annual plants in Sedum-based green roofs.},

abstract = {Background and aims The application of green roof technology has become more common in the central, northwestern and eastern United States, and is now being employed across the southern U.S. as well. However, there is little research evaluating plant survival on unirrigated green roofs in subtropical climates that experience frequent drought and heat stress. Here, we summarize results from a study of plant establishment on a modular green roof in south-central Texas.Methodology Fifteen plant species were field tested in 11.4-cm-deep green roof modules on a four-story building in College Station, Texas with irrigation limited to the first several weeks of establishment. Climate data, plant growth and species survival were measured over three growing seasons.Principal results Four species survived at least two growing seasons without any losses: Graptopetalum paraguayense, Malephora lutea, Manfreda maculosa, and Phemeranthus calycinus. Six species experienced varying levels of mortality: Bulbine frutescens, Delosperma cooperi, Lampranthus spectabilis, Sedum kamtschaticum, Sedum mexicanum and Nassella tenuissima. Five species had no survivors: Dichondra argentea, Stemodia lanata, Myoporum parvifolium, Sedum moranense, and Sedum tetractinum.Conclusions The establishment and survival of several plant species without any mortality suggests that irrigation limited to the first few weeks after planting may be an effective approach on green roofs in spite of the more challenging climatic conditions in the Southern U.S. Since the climate in south-central Texas had been consistently drier and warmer than normal during the study period, longer-term research on these species is recommended to expand knowledge of establishment requirements for these species under a wider range of conditions, including wetter than normal years.},
annote = {Background 
- green roof technology is getting popular
- plant survival on green roofs is important
- little research done in subtropical climates
- there's growth of green roof market
- which plants are viable on green roofs??
- subtropical climate: hot and dry summers, some rainfall here and there
- chose species that maintain root system in shallow, well-drained soils 
- they predict that all 15 species would survive well in green roofs 

Methods
- Southern USA
- Initial plant list: 100 species; all natives
- Used monoculture and mixtures
- Calculated cover as plant measurements
- Extensive green roofs

Findings and implications
- definitely possible to find plant species that survive and thrive on extensive green roofs in warm subtropical climates
- top performers: 
(1) P. calycinus,
(2) G. paraguayense, 
(3) M. lutea, 
(4) M. maculosa
- top-performers were also erect plants; plant height may be important since it minimize interception of solar radiation and thus reduce heat load and potential transpiration rates

abstract = {Root length and diameter distribution are important characteristics to be considered when describing and comparing root systems. Root length and root-diameter distribution may be obtained in two ways: by microscopical measurements, which are laborious, or by computerised analysis, which is fast but sensitive to the scanning protocol. Although scanning protocols vary widely between laboratories, papers rarely report the details. Using two commercially available root analysis software packages (Delta-T Scan and WinRHIZO), we performed a sensitivity analysis of scanning protocols for estimating root length and diameter distribution. The results are shown graphically, rather than numerically, because the interactions between different parameters in the overall scanning protocol are most clearly illustrated by the shape of the curves. The present analysis clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of the two scanning methods with regard to staining period, maximum root density, scanning resolution and transformation threshold. For example, estimating the root-diameter distribution versus measuring root length, puts opposite constraints on the transformation threshold settings. We suggest the following settings for the most sensitive parameters: a staining period of 24 h, a root density of less than 0.5 mm root per mm(2) surface, a resolution of 400 dpi and the automatic threshold for WinRHIZO and a brightness of 200 for Delta-T Scan. According to this protocol, comparison of computerised analyses with microscopic measurements showed good total root length and diameter distribution agreement for three contrasting root systems. We suggest to always start with the present protocol when studying other species. If validation indicates that the proposed scanning protocol needs to be modified for other species, the present sensitivity analysis may be used as a guideline for changing the most critical parameters. Similarly, the use of another stain than neutral red may also require modifications of the scanning protocol. In general, a long staining period (e.g., 24 h) is recommended for all stains, as small differences in staining period have the least effect when the root tissue is saturated. To enhance comparability of results in the literature, the staining period, stain, (maximum) root density, scanner resolution and threshold should always be listed when root data obtained by scanning are presented.},

Leaf PM in different particle size fractions (PM10, PM2.5, PM0.2) differed among the species, by 10- to 15-folds at both test sites. Pinus mugo and Pinus sylvestris, Taxus media and Taxus baccata, Stephanandra incisa and Betula pendula were efficient species in capturing PM. Less efficient species were Acer platanoides, Prunus avium and Tilia cordata. Differences among species within the same genus were also observed. Important traits for PM accumulation were leaf properties such as hair and wax cover. The ranking presented in terms of capturing PM can be used to select species for air pollution removal in urban areas. Efficient plant species and planting designs that can shield vulnerable areas in urban settings from polluting traffic etc. can be used to decrease human exposure to anthropogenic pollutants. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Food webs of many ecosystems are sustained by organic matter from other habitats. Human activities and climatic change are increasingly modifying the quality and supply of these resources, yet for most ecosystems it is unknown how the taxonomic composition of organic matter influences community composition. Along the coastline of Sydney, Australia, the once abundant habitat-forming macroalga, Phyllospora comosa, is now locally extinct. Shallow reefs are now primarily occupied by Sargassum sp. and, to a lesser extent, the kelp Ecklonia radiata. We experimentally manipulated the supply of P. comosa, Sargassum sp. and E. radiata to estuarine sediments to assess responses by macroinvertebrate communities to: (1) changing the identity of the dominant detrital resource; and (2) varying the ratio of input of different macrophytes. Estuarine sediments dosed with P. comosa supported greater abundances of macroinvertebrates than sediments receiving Sargassum sp. or the kelp E. radiata. Whereas plots receiving Sargassum sp. or E. radiata had fewer macroinvertebrates than controls, plots receiving a moderate (120 g dry weight per m(2)) loading of P. comosa had more. Mixtures of detritus dominated by P. comosa supported similar macroinvertebrate communities to monocultures of the alga. Communities in sediments receiving detritus comprised of less than one-third P. comosa were, however, distinctly different. Our study provides evidence that the ecological ramifications of species decline can extend to spatially removed ecosystems, subsidised by allochthonous materials. Even prior to extinction of detrital sources, small changes in their provision of organic matter may alter the structure of subsidised communities.},

abstract = {Plant diversity is an important driver of nitrogen and phosphorus stocks in aboveground plant biomass of grassland ecosystems, but plant diversity effects on other elements also important for plant growth are less understood. We tested whether plant species richness, functional group richness or the presence/absence of particular plant functional groups influences the Si and Ca concentrations (mmol g(-1)) and stocks (mmol m(-2)) in aboveground plant biomass in a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment). In the experiment including 60 temperate grassland species, plant diversity was manipulated as sown species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and richness and identity of plant functional groups (1-4; grasses, small herbs, tall herbs, legumes). We found positive species richness effects on Si as well as Ca stocks that were attributable to increased biomass production. The presence of particular functional groups was the most important factor explaining variation in aboveground Si and Ca stocks (mmol m(-2)). Grass presence increased the Si stocks by 140 {\%} and legume presence increased the Ca stock by 230 {\%}. Both the presence of specific plant functional groups and species diversity altered Si and Ca stocks, whereas Si and Ca concentration were affected mostly by the presence of specific plant functional groups. However, we found a negative effect of species diversity on Si and Ca accumulation, by calculating the deviation between mixtures and mixture biomass proportions, but in monoculture concentrations. These changes may in turn affect ecosystem processes such as plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in grasslands.},

abstract = {Increasing plant diversity in agroecosystems with cover crops has been a successful strategy to augment ecosystem services from agriculture, and increasing diversity of cover crops may provide even greater benefits. Productivity and ecosystem services from multi-species cover crop mixtures were measured in a 2-yr field study of 18 cover crop treatments preceding conventionally tilled corn in central Pennsylvania. Increasing the number of species in a stand increased cover crop biomass (R2 = 0.15). However, mixing cover crop species that were complementary in phenology or N acquisition strategy did not result in mixtures that produced more biomass than high yielding monocultures. Increasing cover crop biomass was positively correlated with several ecosystem services, namely weed suppression, prevention of nitrate leaching, and aboveground biomass N, but negatively impacted inorganic N availability and corn yield in the subsequent cropping season. The cover crop C/N ratio was another determinant of ecosystem services positively related to nitrate leaching prevention, but negatively related to inorganic N availability and corn yield. This study supports the long-held assumption that increasing biomass can enhance certain ecosystem services from cover crops; however, because the mixtures tested did not produce more biomass than high yielding monocultures, opportunities to increase biomass-driven services with mixtures may be limited. The correlation between biomass C/N ratio and ecosystem services in this study also indicates that functional traits, as opposed to biomass alone, will be important for predicting ecosystem services from cover crop mixtures.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that planted wastewater treatment systems outperform unplanted ones, mainly because plants stimulate belowground microbial population. Yet, fundamental interactions between plants and associated microorganisms remain only partly understood. The aim of our project was to evaluate microbial density and activity associated to the rhizosphere of three plant species. Experimental set-up, in six replicates, consisted of four 1.8-L microcosms respectively planted in monoculture of Typha angustifolia, Phragmites australis, Phalaris arundinacea and unplanted control. Plants were grown for two months with 25 L m(-2) d(-1) of secondary effluent (in g m(-2) d(-1): 1.3 TSS, 7.5 COD, 1.0 TKN). Sampling of substrate, roots and interstitial water was made according to depth (0-10, 10-20 cm). Biofilm was extracted with 500 mL of a buffer solution. Microbial density was directly estimated by flow cytometry and indirectly by protein measurements. Biological activity was determined using respirometry assays, dehydrogenase and enzymatic activity measurements. Our results show that microbial density and activity are higher in the presence of plants, with significantly higher values associated with Phalaris arundinacea. Greater density of aerobic or facultative bacteria was present in planted microcosm, particularly on root surface, suggesting root oxygen release. Microbes were present on substrate and roots as an attached biofilm and abundance was correlated to root surface throughout depth. Plant species root morphology and development seem to be a key factor influencing microbial-plant interaction.},

abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity is regarded as one of the most important factors governing species richness gradients. An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity–richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity–richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity–richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity–richness research.},

The experimental design explicitly addresses criticisms provoked by previous biodiversity experiments. In particular, the choice of functional groups, the statistical separation of sampling versus complementarity effects, and testing for the effects of particular functional groups differ from previous experiments. Based on a species pool of 60 plant species common to the Central European Arrhenatherion grasslands, mixtures of one to 16 (60) species and of one to four plant functional groups were established on 90 plots (20 m × 20 m) with nested experiments. In order to test specific hypotheses 390 additional small-area plots (3.5 m × 3.5 m) were set-up. Exact replicates of all species mixtures serve to assess the variability in ecosystem responses. In a dominance experiment, the effects of interactions among nine selected highly productive species are studied. Each species is grown as monoculture replicated once.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

abstract = {Numerous experiments, mostly performed in particular environments, have shown positive diversity-productivity relationships. Although the complementary use of resources is discussed as an important mechanism explaining diversity effects, less is known about how resource availability controls the strength of diversity effects and how this response depends on the functional composition of plant communities. We studied aboveground biomass production in experimental monocultures, two- and four-species mixtures assembled from two independent pools of four perennial grassland species, each representing two functional groups (grasses, forbs) and two growth statures (small, tall), and exposed to different combinations of light and nutrient availability. On average, shade led to a decrease in aboveground biomass production of 24{\%} while fertilization increased biomass production by 36{\%}. Mixtures were on average more productive than expected from their monocultures (relative yield total, RYT{\textgreater}1) and showed positive net diversity effects (NE: +34{\%} biomass increase; mixture minus mean monoculture biomass). Both trait-independent complementarity effects (TICE: +21{\%}) and dominance effects (DE: +12{\%}) positively contributed to net diversity effects, while trait-dependent complementarity effects were minor (TDCE: +1{\%}). Shading did not alter diversity effects and overyielding. Fertilization decreased RYT and the proportion of biomass gain through TICE and TDCE, while DE increased. Diversity effects did not increase with species richness and were independent of functional group or growth stature composition. Trait-based analyses showed that the dominance of species with root and leaf traits related to resource conservation increased TICE. Traits indicating the tolerance of shade showed positive relationships with TDCE. Large DE were associated with the dominance of species with tall growth and low diversity in leaf nitrogen concentrations. Our field experiment shows that positive diversity effects are possible in grass-forb mixtures irrespective of differences in light availability, but that the chance for the complementary use of resources increases when nutrients are not available at excess.},

Plants as resource mosaics: a functional model for predicting patterns of within-plant resource heterogeneity to consumers based on vascular architecture and local environmental variability. – Oikos 94: 493 – 504. Plant characteristics that determine food quantity and quality to consumers exhibit extensive within-plant heterogeneity, and this heterogeneity is an important influence on the interactions between plants and consumers (herbivores, pathogens, mutualists, soil-dwelling microorganisms). Here we present a functional model – based on plant vascular architecture and local environmental variability – that can be used to predict the patterns of within-plant resource heterogeneity. We argue that hetero-geneity is generated largely by sectoriality, the restricted movement of resources along vascular traces within a plant. In essence, the combination of sectoriality and spatial variation in previous damage, nutrient, water, and light availability generates pre-dictable patterns of within-plant heterogeneity in tissue quality. We point out that vascular architecture differs across taxa, growth habit and plant developmental stage, and suggest that certain attributes of the environment maximize the extent of heterogeneity.},

abstract = {In an experiment that directly manipulated grassland plant species richness and composition, decreased plant species richness ("diversity") increased pathogen load (the percentage of leaf area infected by species-specific foliar pathogens across the plant community) in 1998. Pathogen load was almost three times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot planted with 24 grassland plant species, an approximately natural diversity. Eleven individual diseases increased in severity (percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease) at lower plant species richness, and severity of only one disease was positively correlated with diversity. For 10 of the 11 diseases whose severity was negatively related to diversity, disease severity was positively correlated with host abundance, and in six of these cases, species diversity had no effect on disease severity after controlling for the effects of host abundance. These results suggest that increased abundances of individual host species at lower species diversity increased disease transmission and severity. In 1996 and 1997, similar results for a smaller number of diseases sampled were found in this experiment and another similar one. Although the effect of diversity on disease was highly significant, considerable variance in pathogen load remained among plots of a given diversity level. Much of this residual variance was explained by community characteristics that were a function of the species composition of the communities (the identity of species present vs. those lost). Specifically, communities that lost less disease-prone species had higher pathogen loads; this effect explained more variance in pathogen load than did diversity. Also, communities that lost the species dominant at high diversity had higher pathogen loads, presumably because relaxed competition allowed greater increases in host abundances, but this effect was weak. Among plant species, disease proneness appeared to be determined more by regional than local processes, because it was better correlated with frequency of the plant species' populations across the region than with local abundance or frequency across the state. In total, our results support the hypothesis that decreased species diversity will increase foliar pathogen load if this increases host abundance and, therefore, disease transmission. Additionally, changes in community characteristics determined by species composition will strongly influence pathogen load.},

However, plant mycorrhizal traits are rarely considered in plant trait databases and are almost totally neglected in trait-based plant community studies, despite more than 90{\%} of the land flora being mycorrhizal. In this paper I describe and define the mycorrhizal traits of plant species, notably mycorrhizal type, mycorrhizal status, mycorrhizal flexibility and mycorrhizal dependency, which potentially influence plant distribution and community structure. I propose ways of using these traits for large-scale synthetic studies for understanding the role of mycorrhizal symbiosis in vegetation dynamics. I suggest considering plant community mycorrhization – community means of mycorrhizal traits weighted by plant species abundances – and suggest an index of mycorrhization to describe the mycorrhizal trait composition of plant communities.},

abstract = {1. Over 5000 trees were grown in plots of differing diversity levels (1, 3 and 6 species) in a plantation established in Panama. Four and five years after establishment, we analysed parameters related to the productivity of this tropical plantation (tree survival, height and biomass as well as plot basal area) to test for the presence of biodiversity effects. The relative importance of environmental heterogeneity (such as soil, topography, and drainage) and biodiversity on tree growth and mortality was determined using partial redundancy analysis. 2. Hierarchical clustering revealed nine different soil clusters based on soil quality and drainage. By chance, the six-species plots were apparently established on more variable soils then on the other diversity levels. We found little evidence for spatial autocorrelation between subplots, with the exception of four subplots located on a ridge that extends on the North-South axis of the plantation and corresponds to a zone of higher productivity. 3. The redundancy analysis indicated that environmental heterogeneity and biodiversity together explained around 50{\%} of the variation in subplot productivity and tree mortality. Environment explained 35-57{\%} of the variation in productivity and mortality, respectively, whereas diversity explained an additional 23-30{\%}. 4. Our simulation model revealed a significant positive effect of biodiversity on growth but no effect of biodiversity on mortality. The standardized effect sizes that we used to detect over- or under-yielding or no effect in comparison with monoculture were highly variable and the variability was largely explained by traits related to site topography. 5. Synthesis. In our tropical tree plantation, we detected biodiversity effects at a scale relevant to conservation and quantified the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and diversity on tree growth and mortality. Our results support the idea that environmental factors could act as hidden sources of variability in biodiversity experiments. Environmental and spatial heterogeneity induced variable responses to biodiversity and amplified the differences between three- and six-species plots. Species identity explained more variation in productivity than did the species diversity. One species, Cedrela odorata, was associated with increased productivity.},

abstract = {Tree diversity in forests is an important driver of ecological processes including herbivory. Empirical evidence suggests both negative and positive effects of tree diversity on herbivory, which can be, respectively, attributed to associational resistance or associational susceptibility. Tree diversity experiments allow testing for associational effects, but evidence regarding which pattern predominates is mixed. Furthermore, it is unknown if herbivory on tree species of native vs. exotic origin is influenced by changing tree diversity in a similar way, or if exotic tree species escape natural enemies, resulting in lower damage that is unrelated to tree diversity. To address these questions, we established a young tree diversity experiment in temperate southwestern Germany that uses high planting density (49 trees per plot; plot size 13 m2). The species pool consists of six congeneric species pairs of European and North American origin (12 species in total) planted in monocultures and mixtures (1, 2, 4, 6 species). We assessed leaf damage by leaf-chewing insects on more than 5,000 saplings of six broadleaved tree species. Plot-level tree species richness increased leaf damage, which more than doubled from monocultures to six-species mixtures, strongly supporting associational susceptibility. However, leaf damage among congeneric native and exotic species pairs was similar. There were marked differences in patterns of leaf damage across tree genera, and only the genera likely having a predominately generalist herbivore community showed associational susceptibility, irrespective of the geographical origin of a tree species. In conclusion, an increase in tree species richness in young temperate forests may result in associational susceptibility to feeding by generalist herbivores.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity (PD) describes the total amount of phylogenetic distance among species in a community. Although there has been substantial research on the factors that determine community PD, exploration of the consequences of PD for ecosystem functioning is just beginning. We argue that PD may be useful in predicting ecosystem functions in a range of communities, from single-trophic to complex networks. Many traits show a phylogenetic signal, suggesting that PD can estimate the functional trait space of a community, and thus ecosystem functioning. Phylogeny also determines interactions among species, and so could help predict how extinctions cascade through ecological networks and thus impact ecosystem functions. Although the initial evidence available suggests patterns consistent with these predictions, we caution that the utility of PD depends critically on the strength of phylogenetic signals to both traits and interactions. We advocate for a synthetic approach that incorporates a deeper understanding of how traits and interactions are shaped by evolution, and outline key areas for future research. If these complexities can be incorporated into future studies, relationships between PD and ecosystem function bear promise in conceptually unifying evolutionary biology with ecosystem ecology.},

abstract = {The variations in species composition and assemblage of unmanaged simple-intensive green roofs in Hannover, Germany, were investigated over a thirty year period, in order to assess the persistence of the initial seed mixture and to evaluate floristic changes. The roofs were greened in 1985 with soil-based turf rolls sown with a mixture of five grasses (Festuca rubra, Festuca ovina, Agrostis capillaris, Lolium perenne and Poa pratensis). Three sets of 120 phytosociological relev{\'{e}}s, sampled in 1987, 1999 and 2014, have been compared to assess: (1) nestedness vs spatial turnover, (2) functional diversity and (3) the importance of vegetation dynamics on green roof performance and design. Results demonstrated that from 1987 to 1999 the species diversity increased and the species turnover prevailed over nestedness, due to the progressive niche occupation by new species. In contrast, from 1999 to 2014 species diversity remained steady, suggesting that nestedness prevailed over species turnover. The main driver of the observed functional changes was a shift towards relatively more thermoxeric conditions. In terms of plant life strategies, the competitive species sown on the roof gradually gave way to stress-tolerant and ruderal species, along with a progressive increase in species with shortdistance seed dispersal strategies. It is concluded that: (a) to create resilient green roofs, spontaneous colonisation should be accepted and considered as a design factor; and (b) regional plant communities could serve as a model for seed recruitment and installations.},

abstract = {Background: In the industrial biotechnology, ligninolytic enzymes are produced by single fungal strains. Experimental evidence suggests that co-culture of ligninolytic fungi and filamentous microfungi results in an increase laccase activity. In this topic, only the ascomycete Trichoderma spp. has been studied broadly. However, fungal ligninolytic-filamentousmicrofungi biodiversity interaction in nature is abundant and poorly studied. The enhancement of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) activities of Trametes maxima as a function of time inoculation of Paecilomyces carneus and under several culture conditions using Plackett-Burman experimental design (PBED) were investigated. Results: The highest increases of laccase (12,382.5 U/mg protein) and MnP (564.1 U/mg protein) activities were seen in co-cultures I3 and I5, respectively, both at 10 d after inoculation. This level of activity was significantly different from the enzyme activity in non-inoculated T. maxima (4881.0 U/mg protein and 291.8 U/mg protein for laccase and MnP, respectively). PBED results showed that laccase was increased (P b 0.05) by high levels of glucose, (NH4)2SO4 and MnSO4 and low levels of KH2PO4, FeSO4 and inoculum (P b 0.05). In addition, MnP activity was increased (P b 0.05) by high yeast extract, MgSO4, CaCl2 and MnSO4 concentrations. Conclusions: Interaction between indigenous fungi: T. maxima-P. carneus improves laccase and MnP activities. The inoculation time of P. carneus on T. maxima plays an important role in the laccase and MnP enhancement. The nutritional requirements for enzyme improvement in a co-culture system are different from those required for a monoculture system. {\textcopyright} Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

The recently invading polychaete Marenzelleria arctia, which has spread throughout the Baltic Sea, grows more rapidly than the native species Monoporeia affinis, Pontoporeia femorata (both amphipods) and Macoma balthica (a bivalve), resulting in higher biomass increase (biomass production) in treatments including the polychaete. Marenzelleria incorporated and buried bloom material at rates similar to the native species. Multi-species treatments generally had higher isotope incorporation, indicative of utilization of bloom material, than expected from monoculture yields of the respective species. The mechanism behind this observed over-yielding was mainly niche complementarity in utilization of the bloom input, and was more evident in communities including the invader. In contrast, multi-species treatments had generally lower biomass increase than expected. This contrasting pattern suggests that there is little overlap in resource use of freshly deposited bloom material between Marenzelleria and the native species but it is likely that interference competition acts to dampen resulting community biomass. In conclusion, an invasive species can enhance incorporation and burial of organic matter from settled phytoplankton blooms, two processes fundamental for marine productivity.},

abstract = {Enhanced species richness can stimulate the productivity of plant communities; however, its effect on the belowground production of forests has scarcely been tested, despite the role of tree roots in carbon storage and ecosystem processes. Therefore, we tested for the effects of tree species richness on mangrove root biomass: thirty-two 6 m by 6 m plots were planted with zero (control), one, two or three species treatments of six-month-old Avicennia marina (A), Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (B) and Ceriops tagal (C). A monoculture of each species and the four possible combinations of the three species were used, with four replicate plots per treatment. Above- and belowground biomass was measured after three and four years' growth. In both years, the all-species mix (ABC) had significant overyielding of roots, suggesting complementarity mediated by differences in rhizosphere use amongst species. In year four, there was higher belowground than aboveground biomass in all but one treatment. Belowground biomass was strongly influenced by the presence of the most vigorously growing species, A. marina. These results demonstrate the potential for complementarity between fast- and slow-growing species to enhance belowground growth in mangrove forests, with implications for forest productivity and the potential for belowground carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Aims Aboveground biomass production commonly increases with species richness in plant biodiversity experiments. Little is known about the direct mechanisms that cause this result.We tested if by occupying different heights and depths above and below ground, and by opti- mizing the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen, species in mixtures can contribute to increased resource uptake and, thus, increased pro- ductivity of the community in comparison with monocultures. Methods We grew 24 grassland plant species, grouped into four nonoverlap- ping species pools, in monoculture and 3- and 6-species mixture in spatially heterogeneous and uniform soil nutrient conditions. Lay- ered harvests of above- and belowground biomass, as well as leaf nitrogen and light measurements, were taken to assess vertical can- opy and root space structure. Important Findings The distribution of leaf mass was shifted toward greater heights and light absorption was correspondingly enhanced in mixtures. How- ever, only some mixtures had leaf nitrogen concentration profiles predicted to optimize whole-community carbon gain, whereas in other mixtures species seemed to behave more ‘selfish'. Neverthe- less, even in these communities, biomass production increased with species richness. The distribution of root biomass below ground did not change from monocultures to three- and six-species mixtures and there was also no indication that mixtures were better than mono- cultures at extracting heterogeneously as compared to homoge- neously distributed soil resources. We conclude that positive biodiversity effect on aboveground biomass production cannot easily be explained by a single or few common mechanisms of differential space use. Rather, it seems that mechanisms vary with the particular set of species combined in a community.},

abstract = {$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* The plant–soil feedback (PSF) framework has become an important theory in plant ecology, yet many ecological and evolutionary factors that influence PSFs have yet to be fully considered. Here, we discuss the importance of local adaptation among plants and root-associated fungi and bacteria. Furthermore, we show how inclusion of the optimal resource allocation (OA) model can help predict the direction and outcome of PSFs under environmental change.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Plants and associated soil microbes have co-evolved for millennia, generating adaptations to each other and to their local environment. This local co-adaptation is likely generated by a suite of multidirectional exchanges of goods and services among plants, fungi and bacteria, and the constant changes in above-ground–below-ground interactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Resource limitation may be a driver of local adaptation among organisms involved in nutritional symbioses. The OA model states that when an essential resource is limited, natural selection will favour taxa that forage optimally by adjusting their biomass and energy allocation such that productivity is equally limited by all resources. Co-adaptation will therefore respond to the local limiting resource conditions through taxa-specific resource transfer interactions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* The OA model can help predict the outcomes of PSFs across a range of resource gradients and environmental changes such as increasing drought or atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Positive feedback is predicted in systems where resource exchange among plants and associated soil microbes can ameliorate resource limitation, or in systems where microbes provide another important service such as pathogen defence. Feedback strength is expected to diminish as resources become less limiting. Negative feedback is predicted when resources are in luxury supply and populations of opportunistic plant pathogens increase relative to commensal or mutualist microbes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Future, field-based studies that integrate naturally co-occurring systems of plants, microbes and their local soil are needed to further test the hypothesis that resource availability is an effective predictor of the direction and magnitude of PSFs. A more mechanistic understanding of PSFs will help land managers and farmers to manipulate plant–microbial soil interactions to respond to environmental change and to effectively harness beneficial symbioses for plant nutrition and pathogen control.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

Thewater uptake depth of five specieswas investigated across seasons and diversity levels using the natural abundance of water isotopes ($\delta$2H, $\delta$18O) and modelling. Three distinctwater acquisition strategieswere found for trees growing inmonocultures during the dry season: strong reliance ({\textgreater}70{\%})on soilwater fromthe upper layer (0–30cm) (Cedrela odorata), uptake from the upper and deeper layers ({\textgreater}30cm) in equal proportions (Hura crepitans, Anacardium excelsum and Luehea seemannii)and water uptake predominately fromdeeper layers (Tabebuia rosea). Seasonal shifts inwater uptakeweremost pronounced for T. rosea. The water uptake pattern of a given species was independent of the diversity level underlining the importance of species identity and species characteristics in spatial and temporal tree water use. Statistics did not show a significant effect of diversity on source water fractions, but we did see some evidence for complementary water resource utilization in mixed species plots, especially in the dry season. Our results also demonstrated that the depth of soil water uptake was related to leaf phenology and tree transpiration rates. A higher proportion of water obtained from deeper soil layers was associated with a high percentage foliage cover in the dry season, which explained the higher transpiration rates.},

Compared to the nutrient-addition treatment, species richness and diversity were strongly reduced upon nutrient depletion. The functional group of bacterial feeders particularly suffered severely from nutrient depletion. The decrease in diversity of bacterial feeders was linked to reduced species richness and diversity of large omnivorous species, as predicted by trophic-dynamic models. Tilman's (1976) statement, that under low nutrient levels the best competitor dominates the system, was applicable in our system. Upon nutrient depletion, resource depletion led to a monoculture of 1 small bacterial feeder, but even after 2 years of resource depletion, up to 16 species still coexisted. Our results provide strong evidence that freshwater nematode systems can be regulated by nutrient competition.},

Plant genotypic diversity has important consequences for a variety of ecosystem processes, yet empirical evidence for its effects on productivity, one of the most fundamental of these processes, is lacking. In addition, the performance of insect herbivores in response to high genotypic diversity is unknown, despite previous work demonstrating differential herbivore performance among plant genotypes. 2. We manipulated genotypic diversity of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in both the presence and absence of the generalist herbivore Trichoplusia ni under semi-natural growth conditions. We used nine genotypes (eight ecotypes and one mutant) of A. thaliana known to differ widely in functional traits. Productivity and insect biomass were measured in monocultures and mixtures of all nine genotypes grown at multiple fertilization levels and planting densities. 3. In both the absence and presence of herbivores, genotypic diversity increased plant productivity and survival. This effect was, for the most part, independent of fertility or density. Sampling or selection effects did not appear to be wholly responsible for these results as all genotypes were maintained in equal proportion and no single genotype became dominant for the duration of the experiment. 4. High diversity increased T. ni biomass and survival in all treatments. Insect biomass was positively, but not tightly, correlated to plant biomass, indicating that the higher herbivore performance observed in genotypic mixtures was only partially due to higher productivity. 5.Synthesis. Our data support the idea that even within a single plant species, genotypic diversity can exert strong influences on both the producer and herbivore communities. The exact mechanisms responsible for these effects and the relative importance of genotypic diversity in natural communities warrant further investigation.},

In Central and North Europe, as well as in North America and Asia, EGRs are generally included in new building designs, whereas they are still uncommon in Mediterranean countries. The adaptations of many Mediterranean plants to drought stress and their floristic diversity constitute, however, positive elements in finding solutions for them. This research proposes a methodological approach to select wild species for EGRs based on ecological characteristics (using natural ecosystems as templates for green roof design). An extensive bibliographic search on plants proposed for EGRs in Mediterranean countries has led to the creation of a wide database. Other plants were selected considering their synecological, structural, and autoecological characteristics. All the data were integrated in a comprehensive database of 138 taxa potentially suitable for setting EGRs according to their syntaxonomical classification and their ecological behavior (fitting both the Mediterranean and EGR environmental conditions). The selected taxa could enlarge the pool of species for EGRs in Mediterranean cities, increasing urban biodiversity.},

abstract = {The relationship between plant diversity and nitrate leaching into groundwater was investigated in a mid-European semi-natural grassland ecosystem. An experimental approach was used to directly manipulate plant diversity in the field, while holding other environmental factors constant. Species loss was simulated by establishing grassland communities of 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0 plant species, composed of 3, 2, or 1 functional groups (grasses, legumes, and non-legume herbs). Every diversity treatment was replicated with several different species mixtures. Nitrate leaching was determined by continuous extraction of soil solution below the rooting zone and modeling of seepage rates. The concentration of nitrate in the soil solution was highly variable within each level of diversity. In bare ground plots and several low-diversity mixtures containing legumes, nitrate concentrations were higher than the official European Union threshold value for drinking water of 50 mg/L, with maximum values of up to 350 mg/L measured in Trifolium pratense monocultures. Total annual loss of nitrate was unaffected by the number of plant species or functional groups, but it was highly dependent on the specific species composition of the communities, and plots with legumes lost significantly more nitrate than plots without them. Aboveground biomass had no influence on nitrate loss, whereas leaching was negatively correlated with increasing root biomass. The abundance of legumes within a community, litter decomposition rates, and net nitrification were all positively correlated with total nitrate loss. However, in those communities containing legumes, leaching decreased with increasing diversity, because higher species richness led to a reduction in legume dominance, to a reduced nitrate supply through nitrification, and to a complementary uptake of nitrate by grasses and non-leguminous herbs. Based on these results, we expect that increasing the diversity of non-leguminous species or functional groups would reduce the risk of nitrate leaching in low-diversity grass–clover mixtures of ley-farming systems, while allowing for a more efficient exploitation of the beneficial fertilization effect provided by legumes.

Our study investigated (1) how the establishment of green roofs in Sweden was influenced by the establishment method (prefabricated vegetation mat, plug-plant, shoot), substrate composition and species mixture, and (2) whether on-site construction was a possible alternative. The establishment of the vegetation, which in all cases consisted of succulent species, was recorded using the quadrate point intercept method in fixed plots and the success measured as frequency cover. Prefabricated vegetation mats had higher succulent plant cover than on-site constructed roofs. There was no difference in succulent plant cover between plots established using plug-plants compared to shoots. Shoot-established plots had more moss than the other establishment methods. The commercial substrate 'Roof soil' had significantly higher succulent plant cover than the other substrates, which might be related to a higher nutrient content. The organic content of the non-commercial substrates was rapidly decomposed. The standard species mixture produced a higher cover than both the mix developed for northern conditions and the mix with an increased proportion of big leaved species. The total cover of the plots was mainly dependent on the cover of two species: Sedum album (L.) and Sedum acre (L.). Few species managed to establish spontaneously but the establishment of woody species highlighted the need for proper maintenance. ?? 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

In this study, the hypothesis was operationalized as community-weighted means (CWMs) of monoculture values and tested for predicting the decomposition of multispecies litter mixtures along an abiotic gradient in the field.MethodsDecomposition rates (mg g(-1) d(-1)) of litter from four herb species were measured using litter-bed experiments with the same soil at three sites in central France along a correlated climatic gradient of temperature and precipitation. All possible combinations from one to four species mixtures were tested over 28 weeks of incubation. Observed mixture decomposition rates were compared with those predicted by the biomass-ratio hypothesis. Variability of the prediction errors was compared with the species richness of the mixtures, across sites, and within sites over time.Key ResultsBoth positive and negative prediction errors occurred. Despite this, the biomass-ratio hypothesis was true as an average claim for all sites (r = 0{\textperiodcentered}91) and for each site separately, except for the climatically intermediate site, which showed mainly synergistic deviations. Variability decreased with increasing species richness and in less favourable climatic conditions for decomposition.ConclusionsCommunity-weighted mean values provided good predictions of mixed-species litter decomposition, converging to the predicted values with increasing species richness and in climates less favourable to decomposition. Under a context of climate change, abiotic variability would be important to take into account when predicting ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Semi-extensive green roof systems combine many of the environmental benefits of extensive green roofs with some of the aesthetic potential of intensive green roofs. Perhaps most importantly they enable a wide range of herbaceous plant material to be grown without significant structural alteration to buildings. An experiment was undertaken in Sheffield, northern England to determine the potential of semi-extensive roofs for diverse herbaceous plantings. A range of drought tolerant herbaceous perennials with different structural characteristics (low growing, medium height and taller ‘emergents') were grown in two depths of lightweight substrate (100 mm and 200 mm) and with or without limited supplementary watering. Increasing substrate depth without supplementary watering produced relatively few significant improvements in plant performance. However, supplementary watering at both depths promoted growth in the majority of species. Low growing species (those typical of standard extensive green roofs) performed less well under the more productive conditions. The paper discusses the many opportunities for semi-extensive green roofs, particularly where opportunities for additional watering (perhaps from stored rainwater) are available and where public or user access is possible.},

abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems support size structured food webs, wherein predator- prey body sizes span orders of magnitude. As such, these food webs are replete with extremely generalized feeding strategies, especially among the larger bodied, higher trophic position taxa. The movement scale of aquatic organisms also generally increases with body size and trophic position. Together, these body size, mobility, and foraging relationships suggest that organisms lower in the food web generate relatively distinct energetic pathways by feeding over smaller spatial areas. Concurrently, the potential capacity for generalist for- aging and spatial coupling of these pathways often increases, on average, moving up the food web toward higher trophic levels. We argue that these attributes make for a food web architecture that is inherently ‘adaptive' in its response to environmental conditions. This is because variation in lower trophic level dynamics is dampened by the capacity of predators to fl exibly alter their foraging behavior. We argue that empirical, theoretical, and applied research needs to embrace this inherently adaptive architecture if we are to understand the relationship between structure and function in the face of ongoing envi- ronmental change. Toward this goal, we discuss empirical patterns in the structure of lake food webs to suggest that ecosystems change consistently, from individual traits to the structure of whole food webs, under changing environmental conditions. We then explore an empirical example to reveal that explicitly unfolding the mechanisms that drive these adaptive responses offers insight into how human- driven impacts, such as climate change, invasive species, and fi sheries harvest, ought to infl uence ecosystem structure and function (e.g., stability, secondary productivity, maintenance of major energy pathways). We end by arguing that such a directed food web research program promises a powerful across- scale},

abstract = {1. Plant roots, their associated microbial community and free-living soil microbes interact to regulate the movement of carbon from the soil to the atmosphere, one of the most important and least under- stood fluxes of terrestrial carbon. Our inadequate understanding of how plant–microbial interactions alter soil carbon decomposition may lead to poor model predictions of terrestrial carbon feedbacks to the atmosphere. 2. Roots, mycorrhizal fungi and free-living soil microbes can alter soil carbon decomposition through exudation of carbon into soil. Exudates of simple carbon compounds can increase microbial activity because microbes are typically carbon limited. When both roots and mycorrhizal fungi are present in the soil, they may additively increase carbon decomposition. However, when mycorrhizas are isolated from roots, they may limit soil carbon decomposition by competing with free-living decomposers for resources. 3. We manipulated the access of roots and mycorrhizal fungi to soil in situ in a temperate mixed deciduous forest. We added 13C-labelled substrate to trace metabolized carbon in respiration and measured carbon-degrading microbial extracellular enzyme activity and soil carbon pools. We used our data in a mechanistic soil carbon decomposition model to simulate and compare the effects of root and mycorrhizal fungal presence on soil carbon dynamics over longer time periods. 4. Contrary to what we predicted, root and mycorrhizal biomass did not interact to additively increase microbial activity and soil carbon degradation. The metabolism of 13C-labelled starch was highest when root biomass was high and mycorrhizal biomass was low. These results suggest that mycorrhizas may negatively interact with the free-living microbial community to influence soil carbon dynamics, a hypothesis supported by our enzyme results. Our steady-state model simulations suggested that root presence increased mineral-associated and particulate organic carbon pools, while mycorrhizal fungal presence had a greater influence on particulate than mineral-associated organic carbon pools. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the activity of enzymes involved in organic matter decomposition was contingent upon root–mycorrhizal–microbial interactions. Using our experimental data in a decom- position simulation model, we show that root–mycorrhizal–microbial interactions may have longer- term legacy effects on soil carbon sequestration. Overall, our study suggests that roots stimulate micro- bial activity in the short term, but contribute to soil carbon storage over longer periods of time.},

abstract = {Several biodiversity experiments have shown positive effects of species richness on aboveground biomass production, but highly variable responses of individual species. The well-known fact that the competitive ability of plant species depends on size differences among species, raises the question of effects of community species richness on small-stature subordinate species. We used experimental grasslands differing in species richness (1-60 species) and functional group richness (one to four functional groups) to study biodiversity effects on biomass production and ecophysiological traits of five small-stature herbs (Bellis perennis, Plantago media, Glechoma hederacea, Ranunculus repens and Veronica chamaedrys). We found that ecophysiological adaptations, known as typical shade-tolerance strategies, played an important role with increasing species richness and in relation to a decrease in transmitted light. Specific leaf area and leaf area ratio increased, while area-based leaf nitrogen decreased with increasing community species richness. Community species richness did not affect daily leaf carbohydrate turnover of V. chamaedrys and P. media indicating that these species maintained efficiency of photosynthesis even in low-light environments. This suggests an important possible mechanism of complementarity in such grasslands, whereby smaller species contribute to a better overall efficiency of light use. Nevertheless, these species rarely contributed a large proportion to community biomass production or achieved higher yields in mixtures than expected from monocultures. It seems likely that the allocation to aboveground plant organs to optimise carbon assimilation limited the investment in belowground organs to acquire nutrients and thus hindered these species from increasing their performance in multi-species mixtures.},

abstract = {Nematodes present high potential as a biological indicator of soil quality. In this work, it was evaluated relations between soil physical properties and nematode community under sugarcane cropping and remaining of Atlantic Forest areas in Northeastern Pernambuco, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from September to November 2009 along two 200-m transects in both remaining of Atlantic Forest and sugarcane field at deeps of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 cm. For soil characterization, it was carried out analysis of soil size, water content, total porosity, bulk density, and particle density. The level of soil mechanical resistance was evaluated through a digital penetrometer. Nematodes were extracted per 300 cm(3) of soil through centrifugal flotation in sucrose being quantified, classified according trophic habit, and identified in level of genus or family. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation at 5{\%} of probability. Geostatistical analysis showed that the penetration resistance, water content, total porosity, and bulk density on both forest and cultivated area exhibited spatial dependence at the sampled scale, and their experimental semivariograms were fitted to spherical and exponential models. In forest area, the ectoparasites and free-living nematodes exhibited spherical model. In sugarcane field, the soil nematodes exhibited pure nugget effect. Pratylenchus sp. and Helicotylenchus sp. were prevalent in sugarcane field, but in forest, there was prevalence of Dorylaimidae and Rhabditidae. Total amount of nematode did not differ between environments; however, community trophic structure in forest presented prevalence of free-living nematodes: omnivores followed by bacterial-feeding soil nematodes, while plant-feeding nematodes were prevalent in sugarcane field. The nematode diversity was higher in the remaining of Atlantic Forest. However, the soil mechanical resistance was higher under sugarcane cropping, affecting more directly the free-living nematodes; especially Dorylaimidae which was the most sensible to changes in soil physical properties.},

abstract = {Contemporary animal–plant interactions such as herbivory are widely understood to be shaped by evolutionary history. Yet questions remain about the role of plant phylogenetic diversity in generating and maintaining herbivore diversity, and whether evolutionary relatedness of producers might predict the composition of consumer communities. We tested for evidence of evolutionary associations among arthropods and the plants on which they were found, using phylogenetic analysis of naturally occurring arthropod assemblages sampled from a plant-diversity manipulation experiment. Considering phylogenetic relationships among more than 900 arthropod consumer taxa and 29 plant species in the experiment, we addressed several interrelated questions. First, our results support the hypothesis that arthropod functional traits such as body size and trophic role are phylogenetically conserved in community ecological samples. Second, herbivores tended to co- occur with closer phylogenetic relatives than would be expected at random, whereas predators and parasitoids did not show phylogenetic association patterns. Consumer specialization, as measured by association through time with monocultures of particular host plant species, showed significant phylogenetic signal, although the strength of this association varied among plant species. Polycultures of phylogenetically dissimilar plant species supported more phylogenetically dissimilar consumer communities than did phylogenetically similar poly- cultures. Finally, we separated the effects of plant species richness and relatedness in predicting the phylogenetic distribution of the arthropod assemblages in this experiment. The phylogenetic diversity of plant communities predicted the phylogenetic diversity of herbivore communities even after accounting for plant species richness. The phylogenetic diversity of secondary consumers differed by guild, with predator phylogenetic diversity responding to herbivore relatedness, while parasitoid phylogenetic diversity was driven by plant relatedness. Evolutionary associations between plants and their consumers are apparent in plots only meters apart in a single field, indicating a strong role for host-plant phylogenetic diversity in sustaining landscape consumer biodiversity.},

However, plant diversity is constrained by the harsh environment of a green roof, especially summertime water deficit and heat stress. We hypothesized that Sedum species, which are highly tolerant of the roof-top environment, would reduce peak soil temperature and increase performance of neighboring plants during summer water deficit. To test these hypotheses, we grew focal plant species with and without Sedum on a green roof. We then monitored growth during wet periods and drought tolerance during dry periods. During a three-year experiment, S. album reduced maximum growth of neighbor plants, Agastache rupestris and Asclepias verticillata, during favorable growth conditions, but increased performance of neighbors during summer water deficit. In a second experiment, four species of Sedum were each found to decrease peak soil temperature by 5-7 ??C. All species decreased total growth of neighboring Agastache 'Black Adder' during favorable growth conditions, but again increased performance during summer water deficit. These results suggest that the palette of green roof plants can be expanded by using Sedum species as nurse plants. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

FINDINGS:
- sedums were competitors in productive environments, and facilitators in dry conditions
- several mechanisms for facilitation
(1) high photoysynthetic plasticity in response to water deficit: C3 to CAM to CAM-idling
(2) facilitation would be more favourable if co-occurring species grew rigid (less light competition)
(3) dependent on regional weather patterns -- facilitation would fail if green roof was situated in a wet region},

abstract = {Satisfying the nutritional needs of a growing population whilst limiting environmental repercussions will require sustainable intensification of agriculture. We argue that intercropping, which is the simultaneous production of multiple crops on the same area of land, could play an essential role in this intensification. We carried out the first global meta-analysis on the multifaceted benefits of intercropping. The objective of this study was to determine the benefits of intercropping in terms of energetic, economic and land-sparing potential through the framework of the stress-gradient hypothesis. We expected more intercropping benefits under stressful abiotic conditions. From 126 studies that were retrieved from the scientific literature, 939 intercropping observations were considered. When compared to the same area of land that was managed in monoculture, intercrops produced 38{\%} more gross energy (mean relative land output of 1.38) and 33{\%} more gross incomes (mean relative land output of 1.33) on average, whilst using 23{\%} less land (mean land equivalent ratio of 1.30). Irrigation and the aridity index in non-irrigated intercrops did not affect land equivalent ratio, thereby indicating that intercropping remains beneficial, both under stressful and non-stressful contexts concerning moisture availability. Fertilisation and intercropping patterns (rows and strips vs. mixed) did not affect land equivalent ratio. Although intercropping offers a great opportunity for intensification of existing agricultural lands, many challenges need to be tackled by experts from multiple disciplines to ensure its feasible implementation.},

abstract = {In view of the projected climatic changes and the global decrease in plant species diversity, it is critical to understand the effects of elevated air temperature (Tair) and species richness (S) on physiological processes in plant communities. Therefore, an experiment of artificially assembled grassland ecosystems, with different S (one, three or nine species), growing in sunlit climate-controlled chambers at ambient Tair and ambient Tair + 3°C was established. We investigated whether grassland species would be more affected by midday high-temperature stress during summer in a warmer climate scenario. The effect of elevated T air was expected to differ with S. This was tested in the second and third experimental years by means of chlorophyll a fluorescence. Because acclimation to elevated Tair would affect the plant's stress response, the hypothesis of photosynthetic acclimation to elevated T air was tested in the third year by gas exchange measurements in the monocultures. Plants in the elevated Tair chambers suffered more from midday stress on warm summer days than those in ambient chambers. In absence of severe drought, the quantum yield of PSII was not affected by elevated T air. Our results further indicate that species had not photosynthetically acclimated to a temperature increase of 3°C after 3 years exposure to a warmer climate. Although effects of S and Tair × S interactions were mostly not significant in our study, we expect that combined effects of Tair and S would be important in conditions of severe drought events. {\textcopyright} Physiologia Plantarum 2007.},

abstract = {Over the past decade an increasing number of studies have experimentally manipulated the number of species in a community and examined how this alters the aggregate production of species biomass. Many of these studies have shown that the effects of richness on biomass change through time, but we have limited understanding of the mechanisms that produce these dynamic trends. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we manipulated the richness of freshwater algae in laboratory microcosms. We used two experimental designs (additive and substitutive) that make different assumptions about how patches are initially colonized, and then tracked the development of community biomass from the point of initial colonization through a period of 6–12 generations of the focal species. We found that the effect of initial species richness on biomass production qualitatively shifted twice over the course of the experiment. The first shift occurred as species transitioned from density-independent to dependent phases of population growth. At this time, intraspecific competition caused monocultures to approach their respective carrying capacities more slowly than polycultures. As a consequence, species tended to over-yield for a brief time, generating a positive, but transient effect of diversity on community biomass. The second shift occurred as communities approached carrying capacity. At this time, strong interspecific interactions caused biomass to be dominated by the competitively superior species in polycultures. As this species had the lowest carrying capacity, a negative effect of diversity on biomass resulted in late succession. Although these two shifts produced dynamics that appeared complex, we show that the patterns can be fit to a simple Lotka-Volterra model of competition. Our results suggest that the effects of algal diversity on primary production change in a predictable sequence through successional time.},

Typically these crops are grown as monocultures or simple graminoid-legume bicultures; however, ecological theory and empirical evidence suggest that agroecosystem services could be enhanced by growing cover crops in species-rich mixtures. We examined cover crop productivity, weed suppression, stability, and carryover effects to a subsequent cash crop in an experiment involving a five-species annual cover crop mixture and the component species grown as monocultures in SE New Hampshire, USA in 2011 and 2012. The mean land equivalent ratio (LER) for the mixture exceeded 1.0 in both years, indicating that the mixture over-yielded relative to the monocultures. Despite the apparent over-yielding in the mixture, we observed no enhancement in weed suppression, biomass stability, or productivity of a subsequent oat (Avena sativa L.) cash crop when compared to the best monoculture component crop. These data are some of the first to include application of the LER to an analysis of a cover crop mixture and contribute to the growing literature on the agroecological effects of cover crop diversity in cropping systems.},

abstract = {Plants adapt phenotypically to different conditions of light and nutrient supply, supposedly in order to achieve colimitation of these resources. Their key variable of adjustment is the ratio of leaf area to root length, which relies on plant biomass allocation and organ morphology. We recorded phenotypic differences in leaf and root mass fractions (LMF, RMF), specific leaf area (SLA) and specific root length (SRL) of 12 herbaceous species grown in factorial combinations of high/low irradiance and fertilization treatments. Leaf area and root length ratios, and their components, were influenced by nonadditive effects between light and nutrient supply, and differences in the strength of plant responses were partly explained by Ellenberg's species values representing ecological optima. Changes in allocation were critical in plant responses to nutrient availability, as the RMF contribution to changes in root length was 2.5× that of the SRL. Contrastingly, morphological adjustments (SLA rather than LMF) made up the bulk of plant response to light availability. Our results suggest largely predictable differences in responses of species and groups of species to environmental change. Nevertheless, they stress the critical need to account for adjustments in below-ground mass allocation to understand the assembly and responses of communities in changing environments.},

abstract = {1. Plants are multifaceted organisms that have evolved numerous solutions to the problem of establishing, growing and reproducing with limited resources. The intrinsic dimensionality of plant traits is the minimum number of independent axes of variation that adequately describes the functional variation among plants and is therefore a fundamental quantity in comparative plant ecology. Given the large number of functional traits that aremeasured on plants, the dimensionality of plant form and function is potentially vast. 2. Avariety of linear and nonlinearmethodswere used to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of three large trait data sets. The results of these analyses indicate that while the dimensionality of plant traits is generally larger than we have admitted in the past, it does not exceed six in themost comprehensive data set. 3. The dimensionality of plant form and function is a blessing, not a curse. The higher the intrinsic dimension of traits in an analysis, the more easily our models will be able to accurately discriminate species in trait space and therefore be able to predict species distributions and abundances. Recent analyses indicate that the ability to predict community composition increases rapidly with additional traits, but reaches a plateau after four to eight traits. 4. Synthesis. There appears to be a tractable upper limit to the dimensionality of plant traits. To optimize research efficiency for advancing our understanding of trait-based community assembly, ecologists should minimize the number of traits while maximizing the number of dimensions, because including multiple correlated traits does not yield dividends and including more than eight traits leads to diminishing returns. It is recommended to measure traits from multiple organs when- ever possible, especially leaf, stem, root and flowering traits, given their consistent performance in explaining},

abstract = {1. The storage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil is important ecosystem functions. Grassland biodiversity experiments have shown a positive effect of plant diversity on soil C and N storage. However, these experiments all included legumes, which constitute an important N input through N2-fixation. Indeed, the results of these experiments suggest that N2 fixation by legumes is a major driver of soil C and N storage. 2. We studied whether plant diversity affects soil C and N storage in the absence of legumes. In an 11-year grassland biodiversity experiment without legumes, we measured soil C and N stocks. We further determined above-ground biomass productivity, standing root biomass, soil organic matter decomposition and N mineralization rates to understand the mechanisms underlying the change in soil C and N stocks in relation to plant diversity and their feedbacks to plant productivity. 3. We found that soil C and N stocks increased by 18{\%} and 16{\%} in eight-species mixtures com- pared to the average of monocultures of the same species, respectively. Increased soil C and N stocks were mainly driven by increased C input and N retention, resulting from enhanced plant pro- ductivity, which surpassed enhanced C loss from decomposition. Importantly, higher soil C and N stocks were associated with enhanced soil N mineralization rates, which can explain the strengthen- ing of the positive diversity–productivity relationship observed in the last years of the experiment. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrated that also in the absence of legumes, plant species richness promotes soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks via increased plant productivity. In turn, enhanced soil C and N stocks showed a positive feedback to plant productivity via enhanced N mineralization, which could further accelerate soil C and N storage in the long term.},

In particular, data from 27 species grown in monoculture showed that species differed in a trait, R*, which is the level to which each species reduced the concentration of soil nitrate, the limiting soil nutrient and which is predicted to be inversely associated with competitive ability for nitrogen (N). In these N-limited habitats, species abundance ranks correlated with their predicted competitive ranks: low R* species, on average dominated. These correlations were significantly different than expected for neutral theory, which assumes the exchangeability of species traits. Additionally, we found that changes in relative abundance after environmental change (N-addition or disturbance) were not neutral but also were significantly associated with R*.},

abstract = {1. In a laboratory experiment, the influence of host plant diversity and food quality, in terms of nitrogen content, on the larval survival of two oligophagous bug species (Heteroptera, Miridae: Leptopterna dolobrata L., Notostira erratica L.) was investigated. Both species are strictly phytophagous and capable of feeding on a wide range of grass species. Moreover, they typically change their host plants during ontogenesis; it has been suggested that this behaviour is a response to the changing protein content of the hosts.2. To investigate the importance of host plant diversity for these insects, the development of insects reared on grass monocultures was compared with that on mixtures of four grass species. In addition, the host grasses were grown under two nitrogen regimes to test whether nitrogen content is the key factor determining host plant switching.3. Both species had a significantly higher survival rate when feeding on several host plants but only L. dolobrata showed a significant response to food nitrogen content. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the nitrogen content of the host plants and the survival rate of N. erratica larvae.4. The study suggests that at least some Stenodemini need a variety of host plants during larval development but that the level of host plant nitrogen is not the main factor responsible for the observed diversity effect.

We conducted a plant diversity experiment in a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland for treating domestic wastewater in southeastern China. Plant aboveground biomass production ranged from 20 to 3121gm-2yr-1across all plant communities. In general, plant biomass production was positively correlated with species richness (P=0.001) and functional group richness (P=0.001). Substrate nitrate concentration increased significantly with increasing plant species richness (P=0.046), but not with functional group richness (P=0.550). Furthermore, legumes did not affect biomass production (P=0.255), retention of substrate nitrate (P=0.280) and ammonium (P=0.269). Compared to the most productive of the corresponding monocultures, transgressive overyielding of mixed plant communities did not occur in most polycultures. Because greater diversity of plant community led to higher biomass production and substrate nitrogen retention, thus we recommend that plant biodiversity should be incorporated in constructed wetlands to improve wastewater treatment efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many tropical plantations in Central America are monocultures of fast growing, mostly exotic species such as a teak, eucalypts and pines. This has been perceived as a problem for ecosystem stability, pest control, local biodiversity and long-term nutrient availability. In our study, we followed the effects of increasing tree diversity (1, 3 and 6 native species) on aboveground nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) pools in a young experimental biodiversity plantation (central Panama) over two subsequent years. Our results show a positive but not consistent net effect of biodiversity on the N and P pools, mainly explained by the complementarity effect. N and P use efficiencies strongly varied among the investigated tree species and the species richness gradient. Anacardium excelsum and Luehea seemannii were associated with higher N and P use efficiencies while Hura crepitans and Tabebuia rosea were less efficient in aboveground biomass production per unit N or P. Tree species tended to have lower P use efficiencies in the intermediate diversity level compared to monocultures and six-species mixtures. Although the environmental conditions explained a large part of the variation in the N and P pools (58{\%}) in our experiment, we argue that incorporating tree mixtures in the management can bring additional benefits and improve tree growth and nutrient uptake as compared to the monocultures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events are predicted to increase in the future due to ongoing climate change. In particular, floods and droughts resulting from climate change are thought to alter the ecosystem functions and stability. However, knowledge of the effects of these weather events on soil fauna is scarce, although they are key towards functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Plant species richness has been shown to affect the stability of ecosystem functions and food webs. Here, we used the occurrence of a natural flood in a biodiversity grassland experiment that was followed by a simulated summer drought experiment, to investigate the interactive effects of plant species richness, a natural flood, and a subsequent summer drought on nematode communities. Three and five months after the natural flooding, effects of flooding severity were still detectable in the belowground system. We found that flooding severity decreased soil nematode food-web structure (loss of K-strategists) and the abundance of plant feeding nematodes. However, high plant species richness maintained higher diversity and abundance of higher trophic levels compared to monocultures throughout the flood. The subsequent summer drought seemed to be of lower importance but reversed negative flooding effects in some cases. This probably occurred because the studied grassland system is well adapted to drought, or because drought conditions alleviated the negative impact of long-term soil waterlogging. Using soil nematodes as indicator taxa, this study suggests that high plant species richness can maintain soil food web complexity after consecutive environmental perturbations.},

abstract = {Although the effects of plant diversity on herbivores are contingent upon herbivore traits and the source of plant diversity (e.g. intra- and interspecific), most studies have analyzed these effects separately. We compared the effects of genotypic diversity of big-leaf mahogany Swietenia macrophylla with that of tree species diversity on two specialist caterpillars (Hypsipyla grandella stem borers and Phyllocnistis meliacella leaf miners) and three generalist leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) feeding on mahogany in a large-scale (7.2 ha) forest diversity experiment in southern Mexico. The experiment consisted of fifty-nine 21 × 21-m plots, with 64 tree saplings each (3-m spacing between plants). Plots were either mahogany monocultures or species polycultures of four species (including mahogany) and – within each of these two plot types – mahogany was represented by either one or four genotypes. Throughout a five-month period, beginning six months after planting, we measured mahogany growth and monitored herbivore and predator (spider) abundance. We found no effect of mahogany genotypic diversity on either specialist caterpillars or generalist leafhoppers, and this result was consistent across levels of tree species diversity. In contrast, species diversity had significant effects on both specialists but neither of the generalist herbivores. Specifically, species diversity lowered H. grandella attack at the middle of the sampling season, but increased attack at the end of the season, whereas P. meliacella abundance was consistently reduced. Such effects were not mediated by effects of species diversity on plant growth (of which there were none), but rather through resource heterogeneity. Diversity did not influence spider abundance. This study is one of few to directly compare sources of plant diversity, and uniquely compares such effects among herbivores with contrasting life histories (e.g. diet breadths). Overall, we demonstrate that plant species diversity effects outweigh those of genotypes, and our results suggest that such effects are stronger on specialist than generalist herbivores.},

Garden quadrats contained more than twice as many taxa as those from any other habitat type. Ca. 33 {\%} of garden plants were natives and 67 {\%} aliens, mainly from Europe and Asia. A higher proportion of garden aliens originated from Asia and New Zealand than in the UK alien flora as a whole; 18 of the 20 most frequent plants in garden quadrats were natives, mostly common weeds. Garden quadrats showed no evidence of 'nestedness', i.e. a tendency for scarce species to be confined to the highest diversity quadrats. Conversely, species in all semi-natural and derelict land data sets were significantly nested. Compared to a range of semi-natural habitats, species richness of garden quadrats was intermediate, and strikingly similar to the richness of derelict land quadrats. Although species accumulation curves for all other habitats showed signs of saturation at 120 quadrats, gardens did not. Correlations between S{\o} rensen similarity index and physical distance were insignificant for all habitat types, i.e. there was little evidence that physical distance played any part in structuring the composition of the quadrats in any of the data sets. However, garden quadrats were much less similar to each other than quadrats from semi-natural habitats or derelict land.},

abstract = {Stand diversification increasingly emerges as a promising means for improving the multi-functionality and sustainability of management in plantation forests. Increasing tree species richness might potentially also benefit natural enemies, which can substantially contribute to sustainable forest management via top-down control of forest pests. However, there is little empirical evidence on how tree species richness affects the diversity and abundance of predators, as the majority of analyses to date have rarely gone beyond comparisons of monocultures and two species mixtures. Here, we analyzed the performance of spiders as important generalist predators in a tree diversity experiment that uses four of the economically most important broadleaved and coniferous tree species in Europe. We tested the extent to which tree species richness and the identity of the planted tree species affect the abundance, biomass, species richness and functional diversity of spiders. Whereas tree species richness in general had no significant effect, tree species identity strongly affected spider biomass and abundance-with a particularly strong negative effect of the non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Our results indicate that increasing tree species richness does not necessarily promote characteristics of natural enemy assemblages relevant for pest control in forests and thus not all functions that may be important in a multi-functional management context. Rather, tree species composition and identity will often be of crucial importance in determining forest ecosystem functions and services. The fact that the severe impact of Douglas fir persisted even in diversified tree species mixtures suggests that stand-level predator efficiency can be reduced for tree species growing adjacent to or in mixture with this species. This calls for a more thorough examination of the ecological consequences of the increasing use of this species in forestry across Europe, in particular considering that climate change may increase the potential of pest outbreaks and thus the need for adequate control in the next decades. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

We studied the effects of widely spaced nebkhas of Retama raetam shrub on their microenvironment and associated herbaceous vegetation in the Mediterranean coast of Sinai Peninsula. Our measurements included nebkha size (height and width) and shrub size (canopy height and diameter). We identified four distinct microsites at each nebkha: crest, mid-slope, edge, and internebkha space. We measured soil temperature and moisture, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and soil properties. The plant species grown at each microsite were identified and their densities were measured. Average soil temperature and PAR were highest at internebkha space and lowest at nebkha crest. The maximum diurnal temperature and PAR of internebkhas exceeded that of nebkhas. Soil moisture and nutrient concentrations showed a gradient of spatial heterogeneity and were highest at the nebkha edge. Regression analysis indicated that total herbaceous plant density was significantly related to nebkha size, and to shrub canopy diameter and area. Detrended correspondence analysis indicated that patterns of species composition were correlated with the spatial variability in soil moisture and nutrient content along the gradient of increasing distance from the nebkha crest. It is assumed that shrub canopy and its nebkha interact in governing ecosystem functioning in this environment.},

abstract = {A green roof is a vegetated roof or deck designed to provide urban greening for buildings, people, or the environment. Made popular across Europe over the past few decades, green roofs are now becoming more familiar to North Americans as some cities have built green roof pilot projects and adopted incentives for using green roofs or even require their use. Green roof standards and guidelines are also emerging to be used for governance and project specification. Although much is known about the application of green roofs across Europe, much less is known about their application across North America's diverse ecological regions. When considering the many decisions required in applying green roof technology to a specific place, there are few choices more critical to their success than the selection of appropriate vegetation. We conducted a review of green roof research to investigate what is known about the application of plants on green roofs across North America and their ecological implications. Results indicate that investigation sites across ecoregions begin to reveal differences in plant survival. Although ecological investigations are limited, their results show improved plant performance and ecological services with diverse green roofs. We conclude that as green roofs continue to become regulated and adopted in policy, further development of standards and guidelines is needed. To date, there is no common ground for reporting of green roof research, and we make recommendations for facilitating such efforts for improved research, policy development and their management across North America's diverse ecological regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In some cases, naturally regenerating forests are not comparable to the community structure 20 of primary forests after many decades. However, direct comparison of the outcomes of tropical forest restoration and natural regenera- tion is hindered by differences in metrics of forest recovery, inconsistency in land use histories, and dissimilarities in experimental design. 21 We present the results of a replicated reforestation experiment comparing natural regeneration and polyculture tree planting at multiple 22 diversity levels (3, 6, 9, or 12 native tree species), with uniform land use history and initial edaphic conditions.

Most green roof development has focused on maximizing green roof performance by planting one or a few drought-tolerant species. We present an alternative approach, which recognizes green roofs as dynamic ecosystems and employs a diversity of species. We draw links between the ecological and green roof literature to generate testable predictions about how increasing plant diversity could improve short- and long-term green roof functioning. Although we found few papers that experimentally manipulated diversity on green roofs, those that did revealed ecological dynamics similar to those in more natural systems. However, there are many unresolved issues. To improve overall green roof performance, we should (1) elucidate the links among plant diversity, structural complexity, and green roof performance, (2) describe feedback mechanisms between plant and animal diversity on green roofs, (3) identify species with complementary traits, and (4) determine whether diverse green roof communities are more resilient to disturbance and environmental change than less diverse green roofs. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The range and extent of benefits can vary with green wall typology. This research investigated green fa{\c{c}}ades utilising wall shrubs and climbing plants to reduce air temperature adjacent to, and surface temperatures of, brick walls. Artificial wall sections were used to provide replicated data sets in both outdoor and controlled environmental conditions. During periods of high solar irradiance outdoors, the presence of live Prunus laurocerasus plants placed against walls significantly reduced air and surface temperatures compared to blank walls, but also in comparison to excised (non-transpiring) plant sections. Largest temperature differentials were recorded mid-late afternoon, where air adjacent to vegetated walls was 3°C cooler than non-vegetated walls. Prunus also provided significant wall cooling in controlled environment studies, but was intermediate in its surface cooling capacity (6.3°C) compared to other species; Stachys and Hedera providing {\textgreater}7.0°C cooling. When evaluated on a per leaf area basis, however, other species demonstrated greater cooling potential with Fuchsia, Jasminum and Lonicera out-performing others. Not only was it evident that different species varied in their cooling capacity, but that the mechanisms for providing wall cooling varied between species. Fuchsia promoted evapo-transpiration cooling, whereas shade cooling was more important in Jasminum and Lonicera. Plant physiology and leaf area/morphology should be considered when selecting species to maximise cooling in green wall applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Agricultural intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss and has multiple components operating at different spatial scales: from in-field management intensity to landscape-scale simplification. Here we show that landscape-level effects dominate functional community composition and can even buffer the effects of in-field management intensification on functional homogenization, and that animal communities in real-world managed landscapes show a unified response (across orders and guilds) to both landscape-scale simplification and in-field intensification. Adults and larvae with specialized feeding habits, species with shorter activity periods and relatively small body sizes are selected against in simplified landscapes with intense in-field management. Our results demonstrate that the diversity of land cover types at the landscape scale is critical for maintaining communities, which are functionally diverse, even in landscapes where in-field management intensity is high.},

abstract = {* The number of published meta-analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta-analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* We identified 322 meta-analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta-analysis, the quality of published meta-analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term ‘meta-analysis' in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta-analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta-analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Methodological issues for meta-analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* The use of meta-analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta-analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta-analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* Synthesis. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta-analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta-analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta-analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta-analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.},
annote = {Meta-analysis
- observational approach
- summarize conflicting evidence from experiments
- make conclusions about competing hypotheses

Applications of MA
- testing predictions of ecological hypotheses
- combining results across multisite experiments
- assessing impacts of major env drivers
- assessing impact of management strategies
- informing env risk assessment
- testing effects of covariates
- identification of research gaps

Some precautions about inference
- observation approach --{\textgreater} no causal inference
- big MA studies can guide future research
- not just a lit review; it's a change in perspective
- a single study doesn't tell the whole story

Systematic review
- finding meta-analysis papers in plant ecology
- used ISI Web of Science
- removed duplicates
- screened abstracts
- removed inaccessible articles
- 322 studies included from 882

Findings
- most results were from general ecology articles
- very few were in plant population ecology
- common effect sizes: Hedge's d, Cohen's d
- most studies used frequentist approach

Report quality of meta-analyses in plant ecology
- 27{\%} did not have inclusion criteria 
- 33{\%} had complete details of biblio searches

Weighing Effect Sizes
- studies with high precision are weighted more heavily than studies with higher variance
- important to this step because of the following:
(1) increases precision of mean effect estimate
(2) increases statistical power of the tests
(3) improve sample distribution of test statistics
- variance weights can't be reported if studies don't include some estimate of variance
- see text for workaround solutions

Quantify causes of heterogeneity in effect sizes
- problems with covariates:
(1) non-independent covariates
(2) interaction between covariates
- using hierarchial models to nest covariates in metafor R
(1) accounts for nonindependencies

Specificying statistical model and software used
- 33{\%} do not specify the statistical model used
- 15{\%} used various package in R (e.g. meta, metafor, nlme)

Publication bias
- occurs when chance of publication depends on:
(1) statistical significance of the effect
(2) magnitude of the effect
(3) direction of the effect 
- if exists, it can bias any synthesis or lit review
- 61{\%} of papers did not include publication bias
- funnel plots are commonly used, but not the best method
- trim and fill method tests and adjusts for publication bias

Sensitivity Analysis 
- every step in MA requires decision and thus affects conclusions
- sensitivity analyses test how robust the data are to decisions
- some issues can be examined include: 
(1) unweighted vs weighted variance
(2) controlled for phylogeny vs uncontrolled
- sensitivity analysis should always be used

Testing for temporal changes in effect size 
- 5{\%} of papers tested for temporal changes in effect sizes
- some methods to account for temporal differences
(1) cumulative meta-analysis (Leimu {\&} Koricheva 2004)
(2) use publication year as modeator variable (Zvereva et al. 2008)

Controlling for phylogeny
- closely-related species may share similar traits
- possible correlated structure --{\textgreater} violates independence
- 11{\%} account for phylogeny
- different methods:
(1) inclusion of taxonomic rank as moderator
(2) using PICs
(3) weighting effect sizes by phylogenetic covariances
- accounting for phylogeny adjusted effect size by 20-40{\%}

Providing the list of primary studies and MA dataset
- 31{\%} provided dataset used in meta-analysis
- useful to publis to spot errors, update MA
- recommend that each meta-analysis is accompanied by PRISMA flow diagram

Misuses of the term 'meta-analysis' in plant ecology
- incorrect usage of meta-analysis 
- confusing vote-counting with MA
- definition of meta-analysis as 'set of stat methods for combining outcomes across different data sets adressing the same research question to examine patterns of response across these data sets and sources of heterogeneity in outcomes'
- if there's poor quality data, then do a systematic review

abstract = {Plant species identity and diversity may greatly influence the composition of the nematode fauna. In this study the development of the nematode fauna was followed in a field experiment on arable soil with monocultures and mixtures of several plant species. Experimental plots were sown with one, four or 12 species of grass, legumes and forbs and were sampled four times in 7 years. Nematode diversity was little influenced by plant diversity. Due to a pronounced increase of Paratylenchus projectus populations, the Shannon diversity index decreased in several treatments towards the end of the experiment. Differences in nematode faunal composition among treatments increased with time. In spite of the rather long duration of the experiment, the faunal composition did not stabilise but changed continuously. The obligate plant feeders Tylenchorhynchus dubius, T. maximus and Pratylenchus spp. occurred in higher numbers in monocultures than in mixtures of several plant species. Among the microbivores, the abundance of some bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematode taxa seemed to be directly influenced by the plant species identity. In the plots with Trifolium spp. there was an increase of rapidly growing bacterial feeders belonging to Rhabditidae and Panagrolaimidae already after the first growing season. The abundances of some bacterial-feeding nematodes were correlated to total plant production. The numbers of the omnivorous Mesodorylaimus sp. appeared to be influenced by the degree of plant coverage. The abundance of several nematode taxa appeared to be little influenced by the composition of the vegetation. The plant feeder P. projectus and the bacterial feeder Prismatolaimus sp. reacted rather slowly and a distinct increase in numbers was only seen after 7 years, when P. projectus strongly dominated the fauna in several treatments. Among the bacterial feeders, some species with moderate growth rate belonging to Cephalobidae decreased with time in several treatments.},

abstract = {Human-driven environmental changes can induce marked shifts in the functional structure of biological communities with possible repercussion on important ecosystem functions and services. At the same time it remains unclear to which extent these changes may differently affect various types of organisms. We investigated species richness and community functional structure of species assemblages at the landscape scale (1km2 plots) for two contrasting model taxa, i.e., plants (producers and sessile organisms) and birds (consumers and mobile organisms), along topography, climate, landscape heterogeneity, and land-use (agriculture and urbanization) gradients in a densely populated region of Switzerland. Our study revealed that agricultural and urban land uses drove marked shifts in the functional structure of biological communities compared to changes along climate and topography gradients, especially for plants, while for birds these changes were comparable. Agricultural and urban land uses enhanced divergence in traits related to resource use for birds (diet and nesting), growth forms, dispersal, and reproductive traits for plants, while it induced convergence in vegetative plant traits (plant height and leaf dry matter content). These results suggest that contrasting assembly patterns may arise within and across taxonomic groups along the same environmental gradients as result of distinct underlying processes and ‘organism-specific' environmental perceptions. Our results further suggest a potential homogenization of biological communities, as well as low functional diversity and redundancy levels of bird assemblages in our human-dominated study region. This might potentially compromise the maintenance of key ecological processes under future environmental changes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding how changes in plant diversity affect agroecosystem functioning remains a key challenge. We examined how intercropping alfalfa, Medicago sativa, with orchardgrass, Dactylis glomerata, affects the potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae, its host plant (alfalfa), and the efficiency of a leafhopper predator, Nabis americoferus. In a field experiment, intercropping reduced the reproductive efficiency of the leafhopper. Nabis was more effective at reducing leafhopper abundance, and protecting alfalfa from hopperburn, in the polyculture than in the monoculture of alfalfa. In a series of laboratory experiments, we investigated mechanisms by which intercropping could enhance the efficiency of Nabis. Intercropping resulted in changes in vegetation structure and the spatial distribution of leafhoppers, but there was little evidence that these factors influenced the efficiency of Nabis. Instead, orchardgrass, a nonhost for leafhoppers, increased leafhopper movement, and Nabis captured leafhoppers more efficiently when the herbivores were more mobile. These results indicate that intercropping with nonhost plants promotes leafhopper movement and vulnerability to predation, and reveal a novel mechanism by which plant diversity can reduce herbivory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {In addition to an increase in mean temperature, climate change models predict decreasing amplitudes of daily temperature fluctuations. In temperate regions, where daily and seasonal fluctuations are prominent, such decreases in daily temperature fluctuations can have a pronounced effect on the fitness of species and on the outcome of species interactions. In this study, the effect of a temperature regime with daily fluctuations versus a constant temperature on the fitness and interspecific interactions of three cryptic species of the marine nematode species complex of Litoditis marina (Pm I, Pm III and Pm IV) were investigated. In a lab experiment, different combinations of species (monospecific treatment: Pm I and Pm IV and Pm III alone; two-species treatment: Pm I + Pm IV; three-species treatment: Pm I + Pm IV + Pm III) were subjected to two different temperature regimes: one constant and one fluctuating temperature. Our results showed that fluctuating temperature had minor or no effects on the population fitness of the three species in monocultures. In contrast, interspecific interactions clearly influenced the fitness of all three species, both positively and negatively. Temperature regime did have a substantial effect on the interactions between the species. In the two-species treatment, temperature regime altered the interaction from a sort of mutualism to commensalism. In addition, the strength of the interspecific interactions changed depending on the temperature regime in the three-species treatment. This experiment confirms that interactions between the species can change depending on the abiotic environment; these results show that it is important to incorporate the effect of fluctuations on interspecific interactions to predict the effect of climate change on biodiversity.},

abstract = {Foundation (dominant or matrix) species play a key role in structuring plant communities, influencing processes from population to ecosystem scales. However, the effects of genotypic diversity of foundation species on these processes have not been thoroughly assessed in the context of assembling plant communities. We modified the classical filter model of community assembly to include genotypic diversity as part of the biotic filter. We hypothesized that the proportion of fit genotypes (i.e. competitively superior and dominant) affects niche space availability for subordinate species to establish with consequence for species diversity. To test this hypothesis, we used an individual-based simulation model where a foundation species of varying genotypic diversity (number of genotypes and variability among genotypes) competes for space with subordinate species on a spatially heterogeneous lattice. Our model addresses a real and practical problem in restoration ecology: choosing the level of genetic diversity of re-introduced foundation and subordinate species. Genotypic diversity of foundation species significantly affected equilibrium community diversity, measured as species richness, either positively or negatively, depending upon environmental heterogeneity. Increases in genotypic diversity gave the foundation species a wider niche breadth. Under conditions of high environmental heterogeneity, this wider niche breadth decreased niche space for other species, lowering species richness with increased genotypic diversity until the genotypes of the foundation species saturated the landscape. With a low level of environmental heterogeneity, increasing genotypic diversity caused the foundation species niche breadth to be overdispersed, resulting in a weak positive relationship with species richness. Under these conditions, some genotypes are maladapted to the environment lowering fitness of the foundation species. These effects of genotypic diversity were secondary to the larger effects of overall foundation species fitness and environmental heterogeneity. The novel aspect of incorporating genotype diversity in combination with environmental heterogeneity in community assembly models include predictions of either positive or negative relationships between species diversity and genotypic diversity depending on environmental heterogeneity, and the conditions under which these factors are potentially relevant. Mechanistically, differential niche availability is imposed by the foundation species.},

abstract = {Plant species create aggregations of conspecifics as a consequence of limited seed dispersal, clonal growth and heterogeneous environment. Such intraspecific aggregation increases the importance of intraspecific competition relative to interspecific competition which may slow down competitive exclusion and promote species coexistence. To examine how spatial aggregation impacts the functioning of experimental assemblages of varying species richness, eight perennial grassland species of different growth form were grown in random and aggregated patterns in monocultures, two-, four-, and eight-species mixtures. In mixtures with an aggregated pattern, monospecific clumps were interspecifically segregated. Mixed model ANOVA was used to test (i) how the total productivity and productivity of individual species is affected by the number of species in a mixture, and (ii) how these relationships are affected by spatial pattern of sown plants. The main patterns of productivity response to species richness conform to other studies: non-transgressive overyielding is omnipresent (the productivity of mixtures is higher than the average of its constituent species so that the net diversity, selection and complementarity effects are positive), whereas transgressive overyielding is found only in a minority of cases (average of log(overyielding) being close to zero or negative). The theoretical prediction that plants in a random pattern should produce more than in an aggregated pattern (the distances to neighbours are smaller and consequently the competition among neighbours stronger) was confirmed in monocultures of all the eight species. The situation is more complicated in mixtures, probably as a consequence of complicated interplay between interspecific and intraspecific competition. The most productive species (Achillea, Holcus, Plantago) were competitively superior and increased their relative productivity with mixture richness. The intraspecific competition of these species is stronger than that of most other species. The aggregated pattern in the full mixture increased the survival of subordinate species, and consequently, we conclude that an aggregated pattern can promote species coexistence (or at least postpone competitive exclusion), particularly in comparison with homogeneously sown mixtures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

annote = {BACKGROUND
- tested green roof monoculture and mixtures on stormwater retention based on water-use strategies
- Based in Australia (warm dry ecosystem)
- to optimize rainfall retention + plant survival, plants needs to have high transpiration after rainfall + survive dry period 
- biodiversity may improve retention through: (1) transgressive overyielding, (2) selection effect
- but, life-form diversity is likely complicated by differences in biomass and rainfall interceptions
- grass monocultures have higher retention than some life-form mixtures
- possibility: unmeasured traits may affect retention, used plants with different water-use strategies (plastic, conservative)
- hypothesis: (1) monocultures with water-use plasticity should have higher retention than succulents (conservative), (2) mixtures would have higher rainfall retention due to complementarity in aboveground biomass

METHODS 
- greenhouse experiment
- six treatments
(1) bare substrate
(2) monocultures of each spcies
(3) mixtures
- rainfall stimulation from Jul-Oct based on a prior climatic rainfall dataset
- measuresements:
(1) retention + runoff
(2) evaporation
(3) soil water content 
(4) aboveground biomass
(5) belowground biomass 

FINDINGS:
- Green roofs captured 73{\%} of rainfall
- Retention was not always higher in mixtures than monocultures --{\textgreater} affected by watering regime --{\textgreater} water-use strategies
- Certain sedum species have poor ability to retain water --{\textgreater} root systems create preferential flow pathways through substrate
- the presence of Sedum in mixtures created a selection effect (prob higher cover) and reduced performance.

abstract = {1. Traditional tropical agriculture often entails a form of slash-and-burn land management that may adversely affect ecosystem services such as pollination, which are required for suc- cessful crop yields. The Yucat? an Peninsula of Mexico has a {\textgreater}4000 year history of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, termed ‘milpa'. Hot ‘Habanero' chilli is a major pollinator-depen- dent crop that nowadays is often grown in monoculture within the milpa system. 2. We studied 37 local farmers' chilli fields (sites) to evaluate the effects of landscape compo- sition on bee communities. At 11 of these sites, we undertook experimental pollination treat- ments to quantify the pollination of chilli. We further explored the relationships between landscape composition, bee communities and pollination service provision to chilli. 3. Bee species richness, particularly species of the family Apidae, was positively related to the amount of forest cover. Species diversity decreased with increasing proportion of crop land surrounding each sampling site. Sweat bees of the genus Lasioglossum were the most abun- dant bee taxon in chilli fields and, in contrast to other bee species, increased in abundance with the proportion of fallow land, gardens and pastures which are an integral part of the milpa system. 4. There was an average pollination shortfall of 21{\%} for chilli across all sites; yet the short- fall was unrelated to the proportion of land covered by crops. Rather, chilli pollination was positively related to the abundance of Lasioglossum bees, probably an important pollinator of chilli, as well indirectly to the proportion of fallow land, gardens and pastures that promote Lasioglossum abundance. 5. Synthesis and applications. Current, low-intensity traditional slash-and-burn (milpa) agricul- ture provides Lasioglossum spp. pollinators for successful chilli production; fallow land, gardens and pasture therefore need to be valued as important habitats for these and related ground-nest- ing bee species. However, the negative impact of agriculture on total bee species diversity high- lights how agricultural intensification is likely to reduce pollination services to crops, including chilli. Indeed, natural forest cover is vital in tropical Yucat? an to maintain a rich assemblage of bee species and the provision of pollination services for diverse crops and wild flowers},

abstract = {Biotic interactions of plants can have legacy effects mediated by changes in plant traits and soil characteristics. Legacy effects are defined as effects that persist after the causal biotic interaction ceases, because plant traits and soil characteristics are plastic and modifications may be maintained for long time periods. To date, studies on biotic interactions of plants with above- and below-ground organisms and their plant-mediated interactions have mainly focused on short-term effects in the continuous presence of interacting organisms. Little is known about how long the changes in plant traits and soil characteristics persist after the biotic interaction ceases and indirectly affect future biotic interactions and community assembly. Further, since some organisms switch between above- and below-ground compartments during ontogeny, impacts on soil-dwelling larval stages can have direct legacy effects on their above-ground adult stages and vice versa.

abstract = {Large-scale genomic data offers the perspective to decipher the genetic architecture of natural selection. To characterize natural selection, various analytical methods for detecting candidate genomic regions have been developed. We propose to perform genome-wide scans of natural selection using principal component analysis. We show that the common Fst index of genetic differentiation between populations can be viewed as a proportion of variance explained by the principal components. Looking at the correlations between genetic variants and each principal component provides a conceptual framework to detect genetic variants involved in local adaptation without any prior definition of populations. To validate the PCA-based approach, we consider the 1000 Genomes data (phase 1) after removal of recently admixed individuals resulting in 850 individuals coming from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The number of genetic variants is of the order of 36 millions obtained with a low-coverage sequencing depth (3X). The correlations between genetic variation and each principal component provide well-known targets for positive selection (EDAR, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, DARC), and also new candidate genes (APPBPP2, TP1A1, RTTN, KCNMA, MYO5C) and non-coding RNAs. In addition to identifying genes involved in biological adaptation, we identify two biological pathways involved in polygenic adaptation that are related to the innate immune system (beta defensins) and to lipid metabolism (fatty acid omega oxidation). PCA-based statistics retrieve well-known signals of human adaptation, which is encouraging for future whole-genome sequencing project, especially in non-model species for which defining populations can be difficult. Genome scan based on PCA is implemented in the open-source and freely available PCAdapt software.},

abstract = {As better phylogenetic hypotheses become available for many groups of organisms, studies in community ecology can be informed by knowledge of the evo- lutionary relationships among coexisting species. We note three primary approaches to integrating phylogenetic information into studies of community organization: 1. examining the phylogenetic structure of community assemblages, 2. exploring the phylogenetic basis of community niche structure, and 3. adding a community context to studies of trait evolution and biogeography. We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these ar- eas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Despite experimental evidence for effects of primary producer diversity and consumer species diversity on population and community processes, little is known about how diversity at these multiple trophic levels may interact. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine the independent and interactive effects of seagrass Zostera marina genotypic diversity and grazer species diversity on seagrass, epiphyte, and grazer responses. There were no interactions between seagrass genotypic diversity and grazer species diversity, per se; however, the effects of seagrass genotypic diversity on both seagrass and grazer biomass depended on grazer species identity. In particular, seagrass biomass was higher in polyculture than in monoculture, but only when the sea hare Phyllaplysia taylori was the only grazer present. This enhanced growth was due to complementarity among genotypes in the presence of P. taylori. Seagrass genotypic diversity effects on grazer biomass and fecundity were small and/or idiosyncratic, yet grazer species composition had a large impact on grazer reproductive effort. Only grazer species identity, and not seagrass genotypic diversity or grazer species diversity, affected epiphyte biomass, consistent with other findings of the importance of species identity. Our results confirm the effects of seagrass genetic diversity on the plant itself as well as the grazer species that utilize it for both food and habitat. Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of grazers for controlling epiphyte and seagrass biomass.},

Our study investigates tree diversity responses for six early seral boreal forest plantations in Ontario, Canada, representing three conifer species; black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana), 14 release treatments, and 94 experimental units. Dominance-diversity curves and Simpson's indices of diversity and evenness indicate tree alpha diversity. We propose a new method for assessing diversity, using percentage of theoretical species maximum ({\%}TSM) which is determined by comparing post-disturbance richness (S) with a theoretical species maximum (TSM). Our results support the hypothesis that alternative vegetation release treatments generally do not reduce tree species diversity levels ({\%}TSM) relative to untreated plots. The only {\%}TSM (P {\textless}= 0.05) comparison that produced less diversity than in control plots was repeated annual treatments of Vision herbicide at one of the black spruce study sites. Our results generally support the hypothesis that tree monocultures do not develop after vegetation release. Only one out of 94 experimental units developed into a tree layer monoculture (Simpson's reciprocal diversity index = 1). Again this was one of the repeated annual treatments of Vision herbicide at one of the black spruce study sites-a treatment which is atypical of Canadian forest management},

We hypothesized that nonnative desired species (alfalfa [Medicago sativa L., var. Arrow], intermediate wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium {\{}Host{\}} Barkworth {\&} D.R. Dewey], and crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum {\{}L.{\}} Gaertn., var. Hycrest]) increase as desired species richness within seeding mixture increases, and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.) decrease as desirable species richness increases. We simultaneously tested the degree of niche differentiation among desired species. Experiments consisted of 7 seeding monocultures and combinations. Treatments were monocultures of each desired species (3 plots), all combinations of 2 desirable species (2 250 seeds{\textperiodcentered}m-2per species; 3 plots), and 1 plot containing all 3 desirable species (1 500 seeds{\textperiodcentered}m-2per species). Monocultures or mixtures were replicated 4 times by seeding each treatment with four background densities of spotted knapweed (1 250, 2 500, 3 750, and 7 500 seeds{\textperiodcentered}m-2; 7 treatments x 4 background densities = 28 plots). Analysis included regression with the 7 desired species monocultures or mixtures as a fixed effect and spotted knapweed sowing density as a continuous effect. All desired species established had either low or no negative influence on their neighbor, and differed in niche after 7 years of growing in association. Increasing richness of desired species led to increased productivity. Spotted knapweed density and biomass were low across all monocultures and mixtures at the productive site because shade and litter of desired species reduced light availability to the rosette-forming invasive weed. Combining crested wheatgrass and alfalfa provided lower spotted knapweed density and biomass more than did monocultures or grass mixtures because these 2 species appeared to occupy complementary niches. Increased niche occupation by nonnative desirable species may increase resource use and productivity, thus minimizing establishment and dominance of unwanted invasive plants during rehabilitation on arid, marginally productive rangeland sites.},

abstract = {Climate-driven and biodiversity effects on the structure and functioning of ecosystems are increasingly studied as multiple stressors, which subsequently may influence species invasions. We used a mesocosm experiment to test how increases in temperature and CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) interact with functional diversity of resident macroalgal assemblages and affect the invasion success of the non-indigenous macroalga Sargassum muticum. Early settlement of S. muticum germlings was assessed in the laboratory under common environmental conditions across three monocultures and a polyculture of functional groups of native macroalgae, which had previously grown for 3 weeks under crossed treatments of temperature and pCO2. Functional diversity was a key driver shaping early settlement of the invader, with significant identity and richness effects: higher settlement occurred in low-diversity and low-stature assemblages, even after accounting for treatment biomass. Overall, early survivorship of settled germlings responded to an interaction of temperature and pCO2 treatments, with survivorship enhanced in one treatment (high pCO2 at ambient Temperature) after 3 days, and reduced in another (ambient pCO2 at high Temperature) after 10 days, although size was enhanced in this same treatment. After 6 months in the field, legacy effects of laboratory treatments remained, with S. muticum reaching higher cover in most assemblages previously subjected to ambient pCO2, but ephemeral green algae appearing disproportionately after elevated-pCO2 treatment. These results caution that invasion outcomes may change at multiple points in the life cycle under higher-CO2, higher-temperature conditions, in addition to supporting a role for intact, functionally diverse assemblages in limiting invader colonization.},

This study investigates vegetation development on unfertilised thin extensive vegetated roofs during a 3-year period. The vegetation systems investigated were designed to be low maintenance and had a saturated weight of 50 kg/m2, a thickness of 4 cm and drought-resistant succulent and bryophyte vegetation. Vegetation development was investigated in relation to: establishment method, species mixture and substrate composition in a factorial experiment. Vegetation cover was investigated using point intercept. Moss was found to develop on most substrates and reached more than 80{\%} cover on some plots. Sedum album and Sedum acre were the dominant species on the roofs. S. acre was found to decrease drastically after 2 years. The lack of difference found in this study between the establishment techniques shows that there are other possible marketable ways to construct vegetated roofs in Sweden, as an alternative to vegetation mats. Uniform extensive vegetated roofs with a high dominance of succulent species have limited value for plant biodiversity, as few species establish spontaneously. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The larger aquatic plants growing in wetlands are usually called macrophytes. These include aquatic vascular plants, aquatic mosses and some larger algae. The presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes is one of the characteristics used to define wetlands, and as such macrophytes are an indispensable component of these ecosystems. As the most important removal processes in constructed treatment wetlands are based on physical and microbial processes, the role of the macrophytes in these has been questioned. This paper summarizes how macrophytes influence the treatment processes in wetlands. The most important functions of the macrophytes in relation to the treatment of wastewater are the physical effects the presence of the plants gives rise to. The macrophytes stabilise the surface of the beds, provide good conditions for physical filtration, prevent vertical flow systems from clogging, insulate the surface against frost during winter, and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth. Contrary to earlier belief, the growth of macrophytes does not increase the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate in soil-based subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The metabolism of the macrophytes affects the treatment processes to different extents depending on the type of the constructed wetland. Plant uptake of nutrients is only of quantitative importance in low-loaded systems (surface flow systems). Macrophyte mediated transfer of oxygen to the rhizosphere by leakage from roots increases aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitrification. The macrophytes have additional site-specific values by providing habitat for wildlife and making wastewater treatment systems aesthetically pleasing. (C) 1997 IAWQ},

abstract = {1.The relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning is often analysed by partitioning the change in species performance in mixtures into a complementarity effect (CE) and a selection effect (SE). There is continuing ambiguity in the literature on the interpretation of these effects, mainly in their relationship to ecological mechanisms and processes. 2.Here, we present the emergence of complementarity and selection effects in the results of an evolutionary game theoretical model for plant competition which is exclusively based on competition for light. Eight plant strategies, differing only in the time of onset of flowering, were played against one another to determine the relationship between plant trait differences and CE versus SE. 3.We show that competitive exclusion may occur even in the presence of a positive complementarity effect, i.e. when CE {\textgreater} 0. CE was highest at intermediate differences in flowering time. Increasing trait differences may therefore increase CE without leading to co-existence. 4.SE was strongly dependent on which of the strategies was paired. SE was mostly positive if one of the players was early flowering (with low seed yield) and the other strategy had higher monoculture yields. SE was mostly negative if one of the players was late flowering, leading to low monoculture yield for this strategy, but to high gains when competing with strategies that produce less leaf area. The average SE was negative over all pairs. 5.Synthesis. These results show that CE may be positive if the species interaction is beneficial for only one of the two competitors, and the sign of SE depends critically on the underlying mechanism for performance in monoculture. Positive complementarity may go hand in hand with competitive exclusion, while widely different outcomes in SE are possible within a single mechanistic background. Consequently, the way SE changes with increasing richness is not only related to a sampling/ selection effect, but also by the way the interacting species affect the competitive environment. Interpreting the additive partitioning method with a set notion in mind about the driving mechanisms could lead to incorrect conclusions on how species richness effects drive ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {AimsInvasion resistance in experimental plant communities is known to increase with increasing diversity and further to depend on the presence of particular functional groups. To test whether these effects also hold true for the invader establishment phase beyond the seedling stage, we studied survival and performance of Centaurea jacea L. (brown knapweed) planted into experimental grassland communities of varying plant biodiversity over three consecutive years. Moreover, we analysed the role of insect herbivory and biomass of the recipient community for mediating diversity effects. MethodsIn 2005, seedlings of Centaurea were transplanted into experimental grassland communities (the Jena Experiment) covering a species richness (1-60) and functional group richness (1-4) gradient. Half of these transplants and the community surrounding them in each plot were sprayed with insecticide while the other half served as control. In 2006 and 2007 (during the second and third year after transplantation), we recorded survival, growth-related (e.g. transplant biomass, height) and reproduction-related traits (e.g. number of flower heads). Annual data on community aboveground biomass served as covariate to investigate mediating effects of aboveground competition with the recipient community. Important FindingsSpecies richness was the most important factor responsible for Centaurea limitation. Higher levels of diversity decreased survival and all performance traits in both years. These diversity effects were partly driven by community biomass, but not fully explained by that covariate, suggesting the importance also of further processes. The influence of functional group richness was strong in the second year after transplantation and weaker in the third year. Among the particular functional groups, only the presence of legumes showed strong negative effects on Centaurea survival and weak negative effects on growth and reproduction, the latter two being mediated by biomass. Insect herbivore reduction considerably benefited Centaurea in sprayed monocultures, where it grew significantly larger than in all other diversity levels and than in the control subplots. We conclude that effects of plant community properties on invading individuals change in the course of establishment, that plant species richness effects are also important during later stages of establishment, and that biomass (especially at high diversity) and herbivory (especially at low diversity) of the recipient community are important in mediating community effects on invaders.},

abstract = {An experiment was carried out in a climate chamber to analyse if Bt-maize may cause particular changes in soils with different levels of microbial biomass and activity due to long-term management history. Among the soils selected, the ones managed organically for 30 years exhibited twice the microbial biomass and 2.6 times the dehydrogenase activity (DHA) of the soil from a field with long-term conventional maize monoculture. Soils were cultivated twice in a row with Bt-maize, its near-isogenic line and a conventional breeding line. We tested the hypotheses that (a) soil microbial biomass and activity are affected by the cultivation of Bt-maize and that (b) the influence of Bt-maize depends on the level of soil microbial biomass and activity. Shoot and root yield and shoot C-content of Bt-maize were higher than the ones of the near-isogenic line. DHA under Bt-maize was 6 {\%} higher, and the metabolic quotient for CO2 (qCO2) was 9 {\%} lower than under its near-isogenic line, giving some support to hypothesis (a). No significant interactions of the soils and the varieties used were found in this study, thus hypothesis (b) was not confirmed, and soils with different microbial biomass and activity appear to react in a similar way to the cultivation of Bt-maize.},

abstract = {1. Although a major part of plant biomass is underground, we know little about the contribution of different species to root biomass in multispecies communities. We summarize studies on root distributions and plant responses to species-specific soil biota and formulate three hypotheses to explain how root responses may drive species coexistence and ecosystem productivity. 2. Recent studies suggest that root growth of some species may be stimulated in species mixtures compared with monocultures without hampering the growth of other species, leading to below-ground overyielding. Further studies suggest that these responses are the result of reduced impairment of growth by species-specific plant pathogens that accumulate in monocultures. 3. First, we hypothesize that due to pathogen-constrained growth, monocultures are ‘under-rooted', i.e. they do not have enough roots for optimal acquisition of nutrients. Although elevated root production in mixtures represents a cost to the plant, improved nutrition will eventually result in improved plant performance. 4. Second, due to the plant species specificity of the soil biotic communities, we suggest that plant species in mixtures develop an intransitive competitive network in which none of the species is competitively superior to all other species. Competitive intransitivity is proposed as a mechanism of species coexistence. 5. As a final hypothesis, we suggest that pathogen-mediated root overproduction in species mixtures determines the patterns of community productivity and overyielding, both directly, by improving plant performance, and indirectly, by releasing more carbon into the soil, resulting in enhanced availability of nutrients. 6. Synthesis.Recent evidence suggests that species coexistence and ecosystem productivity may be the result of an interplay between pathogen-driven plant responses and nutritional consequences. We suggest that responses of the roots are an important yet mostly overlooked intermediary between soil biota and plant community responses to biodiversity.},

abstract = {Two decades of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research have not yet led to consensus view on how local dominance and biodiversity affect the stability of ecosystems in the presence of disturbances. As natural systems are usually affected by multiple stressors, we tested the diversity−stability hypothesis on phytoplankton communities subjected to combinations of 2 stressors (pH reduction and simulated grazing). Monocultures revealed uncorrelated species' sensitivities to the 2 stressors and the presence of a best-performing species (Scenedesmus obliquus). We thus selected 2 experimental species combinations, either (A) including or (B) excluding S. obliquus, and inoculated at 3 diversity levels (2, 4, 8 species). Both stressors induced significant biovolume loss and increased temporal biovolume variation, but the effect on final biomass (Btot) differed between combinations and with richness. The fast recovery of S. obliquus precluded long-term disturbance effects on Btot in Combination A. Correspondingly, these communities showed slower recovery rates and lower Btot with more species present, since the strong performance of S. obliquus was diluted by more species being present. More species-rich assemblages in Combination B lost more biovolume after stressor application, whereas the recovery rates showed a more complex pattern, depending on stressor sequence and species richness. Our study suggests that the stability of communities in the face of multiple disturbances cannot be predicted from a general diversity−stability relationship alone, but depends on the correlation between species sensitivities to different stressors and on the population dynamics of a well-performing species when dominant.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The effects of principal mechanisms (selection and complementarity) of biodiversity on ecosystem functionality have been well studied. However, it remains unknown how environmental conditions affect the relative strength of these two mechanisms. To answer this question, a controlled pot experiment was conducted in which species diversity was manipulated in low (natural soil) and high stress (mine tailing) plots, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the principal mechanism underlying the increasing biomass shifts from the selection to complementarity with increasing abiotic stress. The shift occurs because species interactions varied with increasing abiotic stress. Competition prevails in low stress plots, while facilitation dominates in high stress plots. In low stress plots, the monoculture biomass of a specific species is a good indicator of the competitive ability of that species in the mixture, and the dominant species significantly affects the plot biomass. In high stress plots, the tolerance indexes of all individual species increase with the manipulated species richness, providing clear evidence for the increasing role of facilitation.},

Little is known about the mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries, community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were collected using pan traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over the active season in 2012 and 2013.

Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We developed an analytical method that quantifies the relative contributions of mortality and individual growth to ecosystem function and analysed the results from the first biodiversity experiment conducted in a tropical tree plantation. In Sardinilla, central Panama, over 5000 tree seedlings were planted in monoculture and mixed-species plots. After 5 years of growth, mixed-species plots yielded, on average, 30-58{\%} higher summed tree basal area than did monocultures. Simulation models revealed that the increased yield of mixed-species plots was due mostly to enhancement of individual tree growth. Although c. 1500 trees died during the experiment, mortality was highly species-specific and did not differ consistently between biodiversity treatments. Our results show that the effects of biodiversity on growth and mortality are uncoupled and that biodiversity affects total biomass and potentially self-thinning. The Sardinilla experiment suggests that mixed-species plantings may be a viable strategy for increasing timber yields and preserving biodiversity in tropical tree plantations.},

Both species richness and identity significantly affected fungal biomass and conidial production (number and biomass of released spores), whereas only species identity had a significant effect on leaf mass loss. In mixed cultures, all measures of fungal functions were greater than expected from the weighted performances of participating species in monoculture. Mixed cultures outperformed the most active monoculture for biomass accumulation but not for leaf mass loss and conidial production. The three examined aspects of aquatic hyphomycete activity tended to increase with species richness, and a complementary effect was unequivocally demonstrated for fungal biomass. Our results also suggest that specific traits of certain species may have a greater influence on ecosystem functioning than species number.},

abstract = {Traditional Mexican coffee plantations, with a diverse shade vegetation of native tree species, are being replaced by coffee monocultures shaded by trees of the genus Inga, resulting in loss of biodiversity and ecological services. Coffee production is said to benefit from Inga shade, but few on-field experiments have been done to support this hypothesis. Secondary production (timber, firewood, fruits, medicines, etc.) is probably lower in Inga-shaded coffee plantations, and that loss could outweigh benefits from increased coffee production. Coffee yields, present stock of timber, and aboveground tree biomass as an indicator of firewood production were measured and compared for plots in traditional and in Inga-shaded plantations in Plan Pared{\'{o}}n, Chiapas, Mexico. Coffee production was similar in both plantation types. Timber production was significantly higher in traditional plantations, and amounted to ten times the timber production in Inga-shaded plantations. Total tree biomass was significantly higher in traditional coffee plantations, but not biomass of tree species apt for firewood. However, firewood production could be higher in traditional plantations. There seems to be no reason to replace traditional plantations by Inga-shaded ones in order to increase production in the plantations studied. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this research, thermal regulation feature of green wall systems is experimentally and numerically investi-gated through a case study conducted in the Jubilee Campus of University of Nottingham. Internal wall temperatures are measured time-dependently for different cases and the results are compared with those of ordinary walls for a reliable and realistic approach. Different sky conditions are also considered within the scope of this research as an independent variable. Experimental results are verified by numerical models carried out in Ecotect. The results reveal that an average of 2.5 °C reduction in internal wall tem-perature can be achieved via green walls with about 10 cm thick climbing vegetation of Hedera helix, which is very promising.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved. Interactions across trophic levels influence plant diversity effects on ecosystem functions, but the complexity of these interactions remains poorly explored. For example, the interplay between different interactions (e.g. mutualism, predation) might be an important moderator of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships. We tested for relationships between trophobioses (facultative ant-hemipteran mutualism) and leaf chewer herbivory in a subtropical forest biodiversity experiment. We analysed trophobiosis and herbivory data of more than 10 000 trees along a tree species richness gradient. Against expectations, chewing damage was higher on trees with trophobioses. However, the net positive relationship between trophobioses and overall herbivory depended on tree species richness, being most pronounced at low richness. Our results point to indirect, positive effects of ant-tended sap suckers on leaf chewers, potentially by altering plant defences. Direct antagonistic relationships of trophobiotic ants and leaf-chewing herbivores-frequently reported to drive community-wide effects of trophobioses in other ecosystems- seemed less relevant. However, antagonistic interactions likely contributed to the attenuating effect of tree species richness, because trophobiotic ant and herbivore communities changed from monocultures to species-rich mixtures. Our findings, therefore, suggest that biodiversity loss might lead to complex changes in higher trophic level effects on ecosystem functions, mediated by both trophic and non-trophic interactions.},

The need is particularly urgent in Africa, where ecosystems are degrading and crop yields have stagnated. An unprecedented opportunity to reverse this trend is unfolding in Malawi, where a 90{\%} subsidy has ensured access to fertilization and improved maize seed, with substantive gains in productivity for millions of farmers. To test if economic and ecological sustainability could be improved, we preformed manipulative experimentation with crop diversity in a countrywide trial (n = 991) and at adaptive, local scales through a decade of participatory research (n = 146). Spatial and temporal treatments compared monoculture maize with legume-diversified maize that included annual and semiperennial (SP) growth habits in temporal and spatial combinations, including rotation, SP rotation, intercrop, and SP intercrop systems. Modest fertilizer intensification doubled grain yield compared with monoculture maize. Biodiversity improved ecosystem function further: SP rotation systems at half-fertilizer rates produced equivalent quantities of grain, on a more stable basis (yield variability reduced from 22{\%} to 13{\%}) compared with monoculture. Across sites, profitability and farmer preference matched: SP rotations provided twofold superior returns, whereas diversification of maize with annual legumes provided more modest returns. In this study, we provide evidence that in Africa, crop diversification can be effective at a countrywide scale, and that shrubby, grain legumes can enhance environmental and food security.},

abstract = {Atmospheric Particulate Matter (PM) constitutes a considerable fraction of urban air pollution, and urban greening is a potential method of mitigating this pollution. The value of living wall systems has received scant attention in this respect. This study examined the inter-species variation of particulate capture by leaves of seventeen plant species present in a living wall at New Street railway station, Birmingham, UK. The densities of different size fractions of particulate pollutants (PM1, PM2.5and PM10) on 20 leaves per species were quantified using an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) and ImageJ image-analysis software. The overall ability of plant leaves to remove PM from air was quantified using PM density and LAI (Leaf Area Index); any inter-species variations were identified using one-way Anova followed by Tukey's pairwise comparison. This study demonstrates a considerable potential for living wall plants to remove particulate pollutants from the atmosphere. PM capture levels on leaves of different plant species were significantly different for all particle size fractions (P {\textless} 0.001). Smaller-leaved Buxus sempervirens L., Hebe albicans Cockayne, Thymus vulgaris L. and Hebe x youngii Metcalf showed significantly higher capture levels for all PM size fractions. PM densities on adaxial surfaces of the leaves were significantly higher compared to abaxial surfaces in the majority of the species studied (t-test, P {\textless} 0.05). According to EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray) analysis, a wide spectrum of elements were captured by the leaves of the living wall plants, which were mainly typical railway exhaust particles and soil dust. Smaller leaves, and hairy and waxy leaf surfaces, appear to be leaf traits facilitating removal of PM from the air, and hence a collection of species which share these characters would probably optimize the benefit of living wall systems as atmospheric PM filters.},

abstract = {The effects of global environmental changes on soil nitrogen (N) pools and fluxes have consequences for ecosystem functions such as plant productivity and N retention. In a 13-year grassland experiment, we evaluated how elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ), N fertilization, and plant species richness alter soil N cycling. We focused on soil inorganic N pools, including ammonium and nitrate, and two N fluxes, net N mineralization and net nitrification. In contrast with existing hypotheses, such as progressive N limitation, and with observations from other, often shorter, studies, elevated CO2 had relatively static and small, or insignificant, effects on soil inorganic N pools and fluxes. Nitrogen fertilization had inconsistent effects on soil N transformations, but increased soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Plant species richness had increasingly positive effects on soil N transformations over time, likely because in diverse subplots the concentrations of N in roots increased over time. Species richness also had increasingly positive effects on concentrations of ammonium in soil, perhaps because more carbon accumulated in soils of diverse subplots, providing exchange sites for ammonium. By contrast, subplots planted with 16 species had lower soil nitrate concentrations than less diverse subplots, especially when fertilized, probably due to greater N uptake capacity of subplots with 16 species. Monocultures of different plant functional types had distinct effects on N transformations and nitrate concentrations, such that not all monocultures differed from diverse subplots in the same manner. The first few years of data would not have adequately forecast the effects of N fertilization and diversity on soil N cycling in later years; therefore, the dearth of long-term manipulations of plant species richness and N inputs is a hindrance to forecasting the state of the soil N cycle and ecosystem functions in extant plant communities.},

abstract = {Producer diversity is known to affect a wide range of ecosystem processes including plant growth and insect pest resistance. Consumers such as mammalian herbivores too have been shown to modify plant growth and insect herbivory by triggering changes in host plants. However, few studies have investigated whether consumer effects interact with plant species diversity effects on a focal plant. To unravel consumer-diversity interactions, we recorded both the presence and intensity of winter browsing by moose (Alces alces) on silver birch (Betula pendula) in a long-term forest diversity experiment in Finland and measured birch tree growth as well as insect chewing damage during the following growing season. Although browsing on birch by moose was not affected by tree species richness, the intensity of moose damage altered tree diversity effects on birch tree growth. At minor browsing intensity, tree height, trunk diameter and canopy projections showed positively humped relationships with tree diversity, peaking at 3-species mixtures. Growth of moderately browsed trees increased with tree species richness, but growth of severely browsed birch trees was unaffected. Moose browsing also altered the direction of tree diversity effects on insect herbivory on birch. Unbrowsed trees experienced lower insect chewing damage in mixed stands (associational resistance) whilst browsed trees suffered more insect chewing damage in diverse stands (associational susceptibility). Increasing browsing intensity also reversed the relationship between tree species richness and insect chewing damage from negative to positive. The observed interactions between moose browsing and tree species richness effects could be explained by lower canopy cover of more diverse stands compared with birch monocultures, leading to increased re-growth capacity and more high-quality foliage of browsed birch trees in more open diverse stands. Our findings demonstrate that both the presence and intensity of mammalian browsing may modify the magnitude and even the direction of tree diversity effects on tree growth and susceptibility to insect herbivory. Differences in consumer impact among studies may thus potentially explain much of the observed variability in plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning and must therefore be taken into account in future studies.},

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that the functioning of an ecosystem is highly connected to the diversity of its biota. However, the influence of biodiversity on ecosystem functions in terrestrial ecosystems has mainly been investigated in grassland. In contrast, forests have long been neglected in this context, though their functional relevance is undoubted. This study investigated the effects of different tree diversity indices (species richness, species evenness, functional diversity) and of tree species identity on earthworm communities in three distinct eight to ten years-old tree diversity experiments. Consistently in all three experiments we found no significant relationships between tree diversity indices and earthworms, whereas they were significantly affected by tree species identity. European larch (Larix decidua) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) had strong and consistent negative effects on earthworms, while the presence of oak (Quercus petraea and Quercus robur) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) increased earthworm abundance and biomass significantly, but effects were inconsistent. Soil pH was only a poor explanatory variable for tree identity effects. The results indicate that tree identity, but not tree diversity drives earthworm communities in young tree stands. The negative effects of larch and spruce may be due to rather low palatability of their litter and to the dense canopy structure reducing soil moisture and temperature, while we found limited support for soil acidification effects. Future studies should consider litter and root traits of trees, and both the effects of trees and herbaceous plants in the understory to explain variations in ecological communities and ecosystem processes.},

In this paper we evaluated the process of Phragmites encroachment into Phalaris stands in two constructed wetlands with horizontal subsurface flow. The results revealed that 50{\%} of the area originally planted with Phalaris was overgrown by Phragmites in 5 and 9 years in the monitored systems while the complete elimination of Phalaris occurred after 9 and 13 years. Replacement of Phalaris did not have any effect on removal of BOD5and COD while removal efficiency of TSS increased after Phalaris was replaced with Phragmites.

abstract = {For the purpose of feeding value, drought resistance and nitrogen utilization, other grasses (e.g. Festuca arundinacea and Dactylis glomerata) than the currently widely used perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne) are introduced in dairy farming, either as a monoculture or in a mixture. To study the effect of these grasses on yield and soil chemical and biological quality, the three species were sown in a field experiment in monoculture and in two mixtures. Within two growing seasons, the grass species tested under high soil fertility conditions did not show significant effects on most of the tested soil biological parameters. Only for the mixture of L. perenne and D. glomerata a higher soil NO3-and mineral N content were most probably related to a higher bacterial activity, possibly induced by dying roots of L. perenne. This was the likely cause of the high aboveground dry matter yield of this mixture. The N-efficiencies of the monocultures of L. perenne, F. arundinacea and D. glomerata were not different when only considering the aboveground biomass. In L. perenne and F. arundinacea the total N in root biomass was higher while under D. glomerata the NO3-in the soil was higher. The lower fraction of mineral N to total N for L. perenne, F. arundinacea and the mixture of the two suggests that their organic matter build-up/mineralization ratio was higher than for D. glomerata. Furthermore, the mixture of L. perenne and F. arundinacea showed significantly lower soil mineral N levels than the monocultures of each. We conclude that grassland systems with a mixture of L. perenne and F. arundinacea are more sustainable than the monocultures of each, in terms of reduction of nitrogen losses and the build-up of soil organic matter. D. glomerata should only be used in a mixture in which the companion grass(es) are maintained. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Planting tree species with desirable traits may catalyze forest regeneration in increasingly common degraded lands by restoring soil properties and attracting seed dispersers. We sampled forest regeneration in an experimental plantation of Albizia lebbek, an introduced N-fixing species, on a degraded pasture in northern Puerto Rico, 27. years after its establishment. We hypothesized that the abundance of animal-dispersed tree species within this unmanaged plantation would be (1) greater than in adjacent pastures; (2) higher at distances closer to secondary forest; and (3) increased over the 20. years since floristic surveys were last conducted in the site. We sampled forest structure and tree species composition, and compared the abundance of animal-dispersed tree species on plots located within the adjacent pasture and the A. lebbek plantation, within the plantation in plots distanced at 10, 35, and 60. m from secondary forest, and within the plantation at 7 vs. 27. years after plantation establishment. We found higher abundance of animal-dispersed tree species in the A. lebbek plantation than in the pasture. Distance from secondary forest had no effect on the abundance of animal-dispersed species. The abundance of animal-dispersed species increased by 14{\%} between 7 and 27. years after plantation establishment. In all, these results indicate that A. lebbek trees facilitated the establishment of native animal-dispersed species by shading out tall grasses and acting as perches for animals throughout the plantation. We found that A. lebbek lost its dominance in the site to another introduced N-fixing species, Leucaena leucocephala, possibly due to unfavorable traits such as susceptibility to pathogens. Our findings document a transition from an experimental plantation to a novel urban forest that harbors an array of native tree species, largely due to the dispersal of seeds by animals. A noteworthy example is the presence of Guaiacum officinale, an animal-dispersed and endangered tree species native to the dry forests of southern Puerto Rico. Our results highlight how monocultures of introduced tree species with desirable traits can catalyze the regeneration of native tree species in chronically degraded lands.},

abstract = {Grasslands provide numerous ecosystem services but their sustainability is threatened by climate change. As plant functional diversity is expected to stabilize ecosystem functions, we tested whether mixing species with contrasting root systems could improve the resilience of Mediterranean grasslands under increasing aridity. We hypothesized that root functional identity (RFI) and diversity (RFD) respectively determines and improves soil water uptake capacity, aboveground biomass (AGB) production and resilience after drought stress (=post-stress AGB/pre-stress AGB). Monocultures, two- and three species mixtures of two groups of perennial grasses (cultivars and native species) were compared in a twin 3-years field experiment under two levels of summer drought in southern France. RFI and RFD were assessed as the mean and variance of multiple root traits (rooting depth, deep root mass fraction, root tissue density, root diameter and specific root length) measured in species monocultures. AGB and resilience were assessed from annual harvests; total transpirable soil water (TTSW) and evapotranspiration in summer (ET{\_}sum) were assessed through the monitoring of soil water content. For both groups of species, RFI was a major predictor of TTSW and resilience, but not of AGB or ET{\_}sum. Greater water uptake, especially from deep soil layers, increased resilience. Rooting depth distribution determined the potential depth of water uptake while root morphology influenced the precision of water uptake along the soil profile. However, RFD only marginally improved AGB production and resilience, although long-term effects of RFD should be tested. Designing artificial plant communities under water-limited conditions should therefore prioritize the maximization of rooting depth and root distribution along the soil profile. Diversifying root morphological traits associated with resource acquisition could also have a positive impact. The similarity of results between cultivars and native species suggests that agro-ecological guidelines for species assembly can be based on advances of functional ecology in natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {This report describes results of a 14 month study of the fate of trace-metal contaminants in wetland microcosms. Duplicated wetland microcosms contained either cattail, Typha domingensis or duckweed, Lemma minor, as the dominant macrophyte. Each wetland microcosm received 14.6 cm/day of dilute landfill leachate amended with lead (measured average: 396 $\mu$g/l) and cadmium (measured average: 105 $\mu$g/l). At intervals of approximately 3 months, sediments and macrophytes were sampled and analyzed for heavy metal content. Differences between measured trace-metal concentrations in inflow and outflow samples indicated that approximately half of the added lead and cadmium were retained in wetland microcosms. Of the fraction removed from the water, less than half could be accounted for in calculated sediment and plant tissue concentrations, based on analysis. The apparent discrepancy in mass balance calculations probably arises from failure to accurately measure bulk density of sediment detritus hoc, which contained a substantial amount of the trace metals. Measurement of sediment acid volatile sulfides (AVS), and comparisons of these concentrations to those of the added lead and cadmium, showed that nearly all of these trace metals were present in the sediments as sulfides, limiting bioavailability and toxicity of these elements. Results of analyses and a lack of overt biological effects suggest that in wetlands containing organic sediments, sediment chemistry dominates cycling of these trace metals. Plant accumulation is of secondary importance. Comparison of heavy-metal uptake by cattails and duckweed shows that duckweed, on a whole plant basis, accumulates lead and cadmium more effectively than does cattail. If plants were to be used in a biomass-harvesting process for metal bioremediation, duckweed appears to be a more suitable candidate than cattail because of high productivity and ease of harvesting, coupled with a significant bioaccumulation of lead and cadmium. Potential metal removal rates by duckweed are 3-8 mg Pb/m2day and 2-4 mg Cd/m2day.},

Cluster analysis revealed significant overlap in leaf choice of M. rotundata and M. centuncularis. There was no significant preference for native leaves, and only M. centuncularis showed preference for leaves of woody plants over perennials. Interestingly, antimicrobial properties were present in all but six plants collected; all these were exotic plants and none were collected by the native bee, M. pugnata. These missing details in interpreting what bees need offers valuable information for conservation by accounting for necessary (and potentially limiting) nesting materials.},

abstract = {A longstanding concept in community ecology is that closely related species compete more strongly than distant relatives. Ecologists have invoked this ''limiting similarity hypothesis'' to explain patterns in the structure and function of biological communities and to inform conservation, restoration, and invasive-species management. However, few studies have empirically tested the validity of the limiting similarity hypothesis. Here we report the results of a laboratory microcosm experiment in which we used a model system of 23 common, co-occurring North American freshwater green algae to quantify the strength of 216 pairwise species' interactions (the difference in population density when grown alone vs. in the presence of another species) along a manipulated gradient of evolutionary relatedness (phylogenetic distance, as the sum of branch lengths separating species on a molecular phylogeny). Interspecific interactions varied widely in these bicultures of phytoplankton, ranging from strong competition (ratio of relative yield in polyculture vs. monoculture (1) to moderate facilitation (relative yield .1). Yet, we found no evidence that the strength of species' interactions was influenced by their evolutionary relatedness. There was no relationship between phylogenetic distance and the average, minimum (inferior competitor), nor maximum (superior competitor) interaction strength across all biculture communities (respectively, P ¼ 0.19, P ¼ 0.17, P ¼ 0.14; N ¼ 428). When we examined each individual species, only 17{\%} of individual species' interactions strengths varied as a function of phylogenetic distance, and none of these relationships remained significant after Bonferoni correction for multiple tests (N ¼ 23). Last, when we grouped interactions into five qualitatively different types, the frequency of these types was not related to phylogenetic distance among species pairs (F 4, 422 ¼ 1.63, P ¼ 0.15). Our empirical study adds to several others that suggest the biological underpinnings of competition may not be evolutionarily conserved, and thus, ecologists may need to re-evaluate the previously assumed generality of the limiting similarity hypothesis.},

abstract = {Plant community functional composition can be manipulated in restored ecosystems to reduce the establishment potential of invading species. This study was designed to compare invasion resistance among communities with species functionally similar or dissimilar to yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a late-season annual. A field experiment was conducted in the Central Valley of California with six experimental plant communities that included (1) six early-season native annual forbs (AF); (2) five late-season native perennials and one summer annual forb (NP); (3) a combination of three early-season native annual forbs and three late-season native perennials (FP); (4) six early-season non-native annual grasses (AG); (5) monoculture of the late-season native perennial grass Elymus glaucus (EG); and (6) monoculture of the late-season native perennial Grindelia camporum (GC). Following establishment, C. solstitialis seed was added to half of the plots, and a monoculture of C. solstitialis (CS) was established as a control. Over a 5-year period, the AF and AG communities were ineffective at preventing C. solstitialis invasion. Centaurea solstitialis cover remained less than 10{\%} in the FP and NP communities, except in year 1. By the fourth year, E. glaucus cover was greater than 50{\%} in NP and FP communities and had spread to all other communities (e.g., 27{\%} cover in CS in year 5). Communities containing E. glaucus, which is functionally similar to C. solstitialis, better resisted invasion than communities lacking a functional analog. In contrast, G. camporum, which is also functionally similar to C. solstitialis, failed to survive. Consequently, species selection for restored communities must consider not only functional similarity to the invader but also establishment success, competitiveness, and survivorship.},

abstract = {Biodiversity experiments show that increases in plant diversity can lead$\backslash$nto greater biomass production, and some researchers suggest that high$\backslash$ndiversity plantings should be used for bioenergy production. However,$\backslash$nmany methods used in past biodiversity experiments are impractical for$\backslash$nbioenergy plantings. For example, biodiversity experiments often use$\backslash$nintensive management such as hand weeding to maintain low diversity$\backslash$nplantings and exclude unplanted species, but this would not be done for$\backslash$nbioenergy plantings. Also, biodiversity experiments generally use high$\backslash$nseeding densities that would be too expensive for bioenergy plantings.$\backslash$nHere we report the effects of biodiversity on biomass production from$\backslash$ntwo studies of more realistic bioenergy crop plantings in southern$\backslash$nMichigan, USA. One study involved comparing production between$\backslash$nswitchgrass (Panicum virgatum) monocultures and species-rich prairie$\backslash$nplantings on private farm fields that were managed similarly to$\backslash$nbioenergy plantings. The other study was an experiment where switchgrass$\backslash$nwas planted in monoculture and in combination with increasingly$\backslash$nspecies-rich native prairie mixtures. Overall, we found that bioenergy$\backslash$nplantings with higher species richness did not produce more biomass than$\backslash$nswitchgrass monocultures. The lack of a positive relationship between$\backslash$nplanted species richness and production in our studies may be due to$\backslash$nseveral factors. Non-planted species (weeds) were not removed from our$\backslash$nstudies and these non-planted species may have competed with planted$\backslash$nspecies and also prevented realized species richness from equaling$\backslash$nplanted species richness. Also, we found that low seeding density of$\backslash$nindividual species limited the biomass production of these individual$\backslash$nspecies. Production in future bioenergy plantings with high species$\backslash$nrichness may be increased by using a high density of inexpensive seed$\backslash$nfrom switchgrass and other highly productive species, and future efforts$\backslash$nto translate the results of biodiversity experiments to bioenergy$\backslash$nplantings should consider the role of seeding density.},

abstract = {The growing desire to make the urban environment more sustainable from an ecological point of view has stimulated research on the architectural and agronomic aspects of green roofs. The practical realisation of green roofs, is however limited by economic and ecological issues. More specifically, water availability is the most limiting factor, and is likely to be ever more so in the future in the light of climate change. For this reason, we evaluated the agronomic performance of several xerophytes in a simulated dry green roof. Seeds of 20 species were collected in typically dry habitats (abandoned quarries, rocky soils, dunes, etc.) and studied in the laboratory for germination ecology. In cases of strong dormancy, methods were tested to stimulate germination and their germination ecology was studied. The resulting seedlings were transplanted in spring 2008 in two green roof types that differ in substrate depth (150 and 200 mm) made up of lapil, pumice, zeolites and peat, resting on a drainage layer of hydroperlite. Temperature and humidity in the substrate and drainage layer were measured during the whole test period. Survival of the seedlings in both substrate depths was almost 100{\%}, favoured by a rainy spring. Most of the tested species showed an excellent performance during the hot and dry summer months in terms of survival rates, growth, and vegetation cover dynamics, notwithstanding the difficult ecological conditions (temperatures around 50°C; hydric potential $\Psi$ -15 bars). Further- more, most of the species had a long flowering stage in the first year of growth. Plants in the green roof with the deeper substrate depth produced, for most of the tested taxa, a significantly higher vegetation cover and growth compared to when they were placed in the 150 mm substrate. The results of this study show that some Mediterranean xerophytes have biological characteristics suitable for their use in dry green roofs, although an irrigation system for emergency use seems advisable. To conclude, further research should focus on long term evaluation of green roof vegetation in terms of plant survival and flowering dynamics.},

abstract = {The temporal patterns of growth and nutrient accumulation into above-ground biomass of two annual coexisting plant species were studied in a semi-arid unfertile grassland. The hypothesis that temporal differences in growth and in nutrient accumulation into above-ground biomass facilitate species coexistence was also tested. Of the annual species identified, only the growth data of Vulpia myuros (L.) C.C. Gmel. and Trifolium campestre Schreb., for two growing seasons, 1991 (wet) and 1993 (dry) were used. The timing of maximum rates were estimated for above-ground biomass growth and accumulation of N, P, and K in above-ground biomass, as well as for the respective rates from the best fitted curves to data of the seven harvests for 1991 and six for 1993 made. The mean timing of maximum rates for the species, averaged over all growth parameters (absolute growth rates, and rates of nutrient accumulation) and years were significantly earlier for the Vulpia. Mean maximum rates of growth parameters, averaged over all species and years followed this order: significantly earlier K{\textless}P=N{\textless}biomass. Absolute growth rates, averaged over all species were significantly earlier in the dry than in the wet year. On the contrary, the K accumulation rates were earlier in the wet than in the dry year. In the wet year 1991 in comparison to dry 1993, higher moisture levels affected the growing period, and the temporal separation of species maxima was more pronounced, which may have resulted in moderate interspecific competition between Vulpia and Trifolium. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Mazel2016,
abstract = {During the last decades, describing, analysing and understanding the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages has been a central theme in both community ecology and macro-ecology. Among the wide variety of phylogenetic structure metrics, three have been predominant in the literature: Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PDFaith), which represents the sum of the branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree linking all species of a particular assemblage, the mean pairwise distance between all species in an assemblage (MPD) and the pairwise distance between the closest relatives in an assemblage (MNTD). Comparisons between studies using one or several of these metrics are difficult because there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the phylogenetic properties each metric captures. In particular it is unknown how PDFaith relates to MDP and MNTD. Consequently, it is possible that apparently opposing patterns in different studies might simply reflect differences in metric properties. Here, we aim to fill this gap by comparing these metrics using simulations and empirical data. We first used simulation experiments to test the influence of community structure and size on the mismatch between metrics whilst varying the shape and size of the phylogenetic tree of the species pool. Second we investigated the mismatch between metrics for two empirical datasets (gut microbes and global carnivoran assemblages). We show that MNTD and PDFaith provide similar information on phylogenetic structure, and respond similarly to variation in species richness and assemblage structure. However, MPD demonstrate a very different behaviour, and is highly sensitive to deep branching structure. We suggest that by combining complementary metrics that are sensitive to processes operating at different phylogenetic depths (i.e. MPD and MNTD or PDFaith) we can obtain a better understanding of assemblage structure.},
annote = {- considered phylogenetic distances between species as a substitute for niche differenes (hotly debated though)
- usual expectation: competition-driven coexistence will generate patterns of phylogenetic 'over-dispersion'
- hot debate, but we do see nonrandom phylogenetic community structure
- to test for phylogenetic structures, a lot of metrics have been created; MPD, PD and MNTD are commonly used, and represent different 'phylogenetic' dimensions
- MPD may be more sensitive to basal structure, while MNTD is influenced by the terminal structure
- depends on phylogenetic scale as well, species poor communities likely have less complex structures that are more easily detected by all three metrics},

abstract = {Phytoplankton play an important role as primary producers and thus can affect higher trophic levels. Phytoplankton growth and diversity may, besides other factors, be controlled by seasonal temperature changes and increasing water temperatures. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of temperature and diversity on phytoplankton growth. In a controlled laboratory experiment, monocultures of 15 freshwater phytoplankton taxa (green algae, cyanobacteria, and diatoms) as well as 25 mixed communities of different species richness (2-12 species) and taxa composition were exposed to constant temperatures of 12, 18, and 24 °C. Additionally, they were exposed to short-term daily temperature peaks of +4 °C. Increased species richness had a positive effect on phytoplankton growth rates and phosphorous content at all temperature levels, with maximum values occurring at 18 °C. Overyielding was observed at almost all temperature levels and could mostly be explained by complementary traits. Higher temperatures resulted in higher fractions of cyanobacteria in communities. This negative effect of temperature on phytoplankton diversity following a shift in community composition was most obvious in communities adapted to cooler temperatures, pointing to the assumption that relative temperature changes may be more important than absolute ones.},

abstract = {The global demand for cacao has recently increased. To meet this demand, the cultivated area has been expanded in tropical forest areas and production has intensified by replacing traditional agroforestry systems with monocultures. This has led to a loss of biodiversity in cacao-growing areas. More sustainable production systems such as agroforestry and organic managed systems are expected to yield less cacao, but by-crops and premium prices, respectively, might economically compensate for the lower yields. Here, we compared the productivity and the return on labor, that is the return per working day, of four different cacao production systems: agroforestry and monocultures under organic and conventional management. Cacao and by-crop yields, costs, revenues, and labor were registered during the first 5 years after establishment. Results show that cacao yields were, on average, 41{\%} higher in monocultures, but the revenues derived from agroforestry by-crops economically overcompensated for this difference. Indeed, the return on labor across the years was roughly twice as high in the agroforestry systems compared to the monocultures. We found similar cacao yields and return on labor in conventional and organically managed agroforestry systems. However, in the monocultures, cacao yields were 48{\%} lower under organic compared with conventional farming, but the return on labor was similar, mainly due to the higher costs associated to the conventional management. Overall, our findings show that cacao agroforestry systems have higher return on labor.},

abstract = {To preserve populations of endangered bee species, sound knowledge of their maximum foraging distance between nest and host plants is crucial. Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200 m for small bee species and up to 1100 m for very large species based on mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus, were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants. Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands. The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus punctulatissimus was 1100 m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi 1275 m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400 m, indicating that maximum foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However, the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied only to a small percentage of individuals as 50{\%} of the females of H. punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than 100-225 m and 300 m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species specific maximum foraging distances. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study focused on the relationship between plant diversity (six species richness levels) and nutrient retention and enzyme activities associated with carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in a full-scale constructed wetland (CW) fed with post-treatment domestic wastewater. Effects of plant species richness on nutrient retention and enzyme activities were assessed using soil chemical and zymological methods, respectively. Retention of NH4-N and NO3-N in the wetland substrate increased with increasing species richness, while phosphorus retention significantly decreased under the richness level of 16 species per plot. Activities of enzymes such as dehydrogenase, $\beta$-glucosidase, invertase, phenol oxidase, L-arsparaginase, protease and nitrate reductase, while they were affected by plant species richness, were strongly depended on the presence or absence of plants in CW substrate, while activities of enzymes such as CM-cellulase, urease and acid phosphatase were strongly depended on plant species richness. We conclude that plant species richness influenced nutrient retention and enzyme activities in the substrate in our subtropical CW; increase plant species richness in CW will likely improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Communities were established from seed in 2002 and contained 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 60 plant species of 1, 2, 3 or 4 functional groups. In 2004, pairs of enclosure cages (1 m tall, 0.5 m diameter) were set up on all 81 plots. One randomly selected cage of each pair was stocked with 10 male and 10 female nymphs of the meadow grasshopper, Chorthippus parallelus. The grasshoppers fed for 2 months, and the vegetation was monitored over 1 year. Consumption resistance and recovery of vegetation were calculated as proportional changes in vegetation biomass. Overall, grasshopper herbivory averaged 6.8{\%}. Herbivory resistance and recovery were influenced by plant functional group identity, but independent of plant species richness and number of functional groups. However, herbivory induced shifts in vegetation composition that depended on plant species richness. Grasshopper herbivory led to increases in herb cover at the expense of grasses. Herb cover increased more strongly in species-rich mixtures. We conclude that selective herbivory changes the functional composition of plant communities and that compositional changes due to selective herbivory depend on plant species richness.},

abstract = {Creating a crop-heterogeneous system by intraspecific mixtures of different rice varieties can substantially reduce blast diseases. Such variety mixtures provide an ecological approach for effective disease control, maintaining high yields with the minimum fungicide applications. Whether such an approach is universally applicable for random rice variety combinations and what is the variation pattern of the diseases under intercropping still remains unclear. We conducted two-year large-scale field experiments involving 47 rice varieties/lines and 98 variety-combinations to compare the occurrence of rice blast in monoculture and intercropping plots at multiple sites. In the experiments, the plant height of the selected traditional varieties was about 30 cm taller, and their life cycle was 10 days longer, than that of the improved rice varieties. The monoculture included either traditional or modern rice varieties grown in separate plots. The intercropping included both traditional and modern rice varieties planted together in the same plots. Results from the field experiments under natural disease conditions demonstrated significant reduction for rice blast disease in intercropping plots, compared with that in monoculture plots. For traditional varieties, the average blast incidence reduced from {\~{}}26{\%} in monoculture to {\~{}}10{\%} in intercropping, and the disease severity reduced from {\~{}}17 in monoculture to {\~{}}5 in intercropping. For modern varieties, the average blast incidence reduced from {\~{}}19{\%} in monoculture to {\~{}}10{\%} in intercropping, and the severity from {\~{}}10 in monoculture to {\~{}}4 in intercropping. Traditional rice varieties ({\~{}}72{\%}) had a much greater increase in the efficiency of disease control than modern varieties ({\~{}}60{\%}). In addition, substantially lower values of variance in the blast incidence and severity was detected among the variety combinations in intercropping plots than in monoculture plots. Based on these results, we conclude that the intercropping or mixture of rice varieties greatly reduces the occurrence and variation of rice blast disease in particular variety combinations, which makes the intercropping system more stable and consistent for disease suppression on a large scale of rice cultivation.},

abstract = {1. Plants encounter a variety of light and nutrient availabilities during succession. However, there is an ongoing debate to which extent light-dependent structural and physiological plasticity is associated with species shade tolerance. 2. Seedlings of five species, Betula pubescens Ehrh., B. pendula Roth, Populus tremula L., Quercus robur L. and Acer platanoides L. (from most intolerant to most shade-tolerant), were grown at four different light and nutrient availabilities to test the hypotheses that intolerant species have higher physiological and tolerant species higher structural plasticity to light and also that there is an overall increase in plasticity with increasing nutrient availability. Two replicate experiments in different years were conducted. Plasticity was characterized by four estimates: (1) the range of variation of the components of relative growth rate (RGR), leaf area ratio (LAR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) (RGR = LAR{\textperiodcentered}NAR) at common RGR; (2) average standardized slopes of physiological (RGR, NAR, i.e. physiological plasticity, $\Pi$ P ) and structural (LAR, leaf dry mass per unit area, biomass allocation traits, i.e. structural plasticity, $\Pi$ S ) traits vs. irradiance relationships; (3) standardized difference of plant traits measured at low to medium irradiance; (4) coefficient of variation across different irradiance treatments. 3. Plant growth was more strongly associated with NAR than with structural traits, but shade-intolerant species had a greater range of variation in both NAR and LAR at a common RGR. RGR, NAR and structural characteristics also responded more strongly to increases in irradiance in shade-intolerant species, but at low irradiance RGR and NAR were similar among all species. Owing to higher biomass fraction in leaves, the intolerant species produced less woody biomass. In nonfertilized plants, both $\Pi$ P and $\Pi$ S were negatively associated with shade tolerance. The plasticity was enhanced by nutrient addition, but the nutrient-dependent enhancement in plasticity was greater in more tolerant species. Therefore, differences in plasticity among species of varying tolerance were lower at higher nutrient availability. 4. Our study does not support the hypothesis of a trade-off between structural and physiological plasticity. Shade-tolerant species are generally less plastic than intolerant species, but increases in nutrient availability during succession reduce the differences in plasticity. Despite similar RGR in low light, first-year seedlings of shade-tolerant species produce more woody biomass, favouring survival and growth in subsequent years.},

Trin. ex Steudel and two cyperacean species, viz. Scirpus maritimus L. and S. lacustris L.) was studied in relation to growth responses in the water-depth gradient. Stands of S. lacustris were found at lower depths relative to the mean water level (average fringe depth 69 ± 19 cm) than stands of Phragmites australis (av. 45 ± 20 cm), S. maritimus (av. 36 ± 8 cm) and Phalaris arundinacea (av. 25 ± 8 cm). The growth responses to a gradient of water depth were studied by planting the four species at five distinct water depths in outdoor basins, and determining morphological parameters and biomass distributions of the species grown for two consecutive years. The biomass of Phalaris arundinacea was reduced below 30 cm water depth, while Phragmites australis and S. maritimus showed reduced biomass at 80 cm water depth. S. lacustris showed no biomass reduction even at 80 cm water depth. An increased above-ground: below-ground biomass ratio in deeper water was demonstrated for each of the species under study; however, the modification of biomass distribution in the gramineous species occurred abruptly in very shallow water contrary to the cyperacean species. Mean basal stem diameter increased with water depth in all four species. Mean stem length increased with water depth in three of the four species. Stem elongation with increasing water depth was strongest in the cyperacean species. The gramineous species showed enhanced formation of adventitious roots at submerged nodes. The similarity of responses to water depth was greatest within each of the groups of gramineous and cyperacean species. The responses reflect the zonation of the species along the water- depth gradient: S. lacustris in relatively deep water. Phragmites australis and S. maritimus in shallower water, and Phalaris arundinacea in very shallow water.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Plants have numerous impacts on biogeochemical cycling across both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. These effects extend well beyond the critical role of carbon (C) fixation through photo- synthesis that provides the basis for ecosystem energy flow. While foliar and root traits of senescent plant material (litter) have been explored in detail in terrestrial ecosystems, there is a resurgence of interest in how plants modulate biogeochemical cycling in ways other than litter quality effects on C and nutrient mineralization. 2. This Special Feature represents a collection of ‘fresh' perspectives on how plants alone, or in interaction with other organisms, have important and lasting impacts on biogeochemical cycles of C and nutrients in a range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. 3. We begin in the open ocean and then peer from the forest edge before moving into forest under- storeys and grasslands to examine the control by live terrestrial plants on ecosystem C and nutrient cycling. Plants directly affect biogeochemical cycling while living through their diversity and com- position, nutrient capture and strategies for assimilating C, and by altering the microclimate for decomposition. In addition, how they construct their tissues and alter the abiotic environment has large impacts on the turnover of C and nutrients once plants have senesced or died. From the direct impact of plants, we move onto the influence of plant–insect interactions, which effectively deter- mine changes in plant stoichiometry in grasslands of varying diversity. Finally, looking directly in the soil, it is clear that plant–mycorrhizae interactions are important in modulating the response of litter decomposition to nutrient addition and the nature of C metabolism in the soil. 4. Synthesis. The papers here highlight careful matching between how plants live and their biotic and abiotic contexts. Taken together, it appears that the dynamic, rather than passive, nature of plant responses to variable environments is key in affecting ecosystem level processes of C and nutrient turnover. This Special Feature highlights a diversity of connections between plants and their envi- ronment and demonstrates that in both life and death, how plants respond to these changes differs among plant lineages and this diversity will play a central role in determining biogeochemical cycling in the future in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems},

abstract = {What is the observed relationship between plant species diversity and spatial environmental heterogeneity? Does the relationship scale predictably with sample plot size? What are the relative contributions to diversity patterns of variables linked to productivity or available energy compared to those corresponding to spatial heterogeneity? Observational and experimental studies that quantified relationships between plant species richness and within-sample spatial environmental heterogeneity were reviewed. Effect size in experimental studies was quantified as the standardized mean difference between control (homogeneous) and heterogeneous treatments. For observational studies, effect sizes in individual studies were examined graphically across a gradient of plot size (focal scale). Relative contributions of variables representing spatial heterogeneity were compared to those representing available energy using a response ratio. Forty-one observational and 11 experimental studies quantified plant species diversity and spatial environmental heterogeneity. Observational studies reported positive species diversity-spatial heterogeneity correlations at all points across a plot size gradient from similar to 1.0 x 10(-1) to similar to 1.0 x 10(11) m(2), although many studies reported spatial heterogeneity variables with no significant relationships to species diversity. The cross-study effect size in experimental studies was not significantly different from zero. Available energy variables explained consistently more of the variance in species richness than spatial heterogeneity variables, especially at the smallest and largest plot sizes. Species diversity was not related to spatial heterogeneity in a way predictable by plot size. Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships were common, confirming the importance of niche differentiation in species diversity patterns, but future studies examining a range of spatial scales in the same system are required to determine the role of dispersal and available energy in these patterns.},

In forests, roots account for a major component of carbon cycling, yet few studies have examined ranges of root trait variation and how different species vary in root form and function in these communities. Root branching intensity, specific root length (SRL; root length per unit dry mass), root diameter, tissue density, phenolic concentration and nitrogen concentration were determined for the finest two root orders of 25 co-existing North American woody species sampled from mature plants in a single forest community. Trait correlations and multivariate patterns were examined to evaluate the most important trait differences among species. Branching intensity, SRL, and phenolic concentration varied most widely among species (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.42, 0.57 and 0.58, respectively). Species predominately forming ectomycorrhiza (EM) had a higher branching intensity than those forming arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) with mycorrhizal types correctly predicted in c. 70{\%} of individual observations by branching intensity alone. There was notably no correlation between SRL and nitrogen. Variation in SRL among species mapped partially along phylogenetic lines (consistency index (CI) = 0.44), with remaining variation attributable to differences in species' ecological specialization. Variation found in root traits suggests different nutrient acquisition strategies within this community, which could have potential species-level effects on carbon and mineral nutrient cycling.},

abstract = {1.Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2.Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3.We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's $\lambda$ performed well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's $\lambda$ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4.Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5.We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6.These guidelines aim to better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades.},

Water-retention additives have the potential to increase substrate water availability leading to greater plant growth and survival, expanding the range of plant species suitable for green roofs. We determined whether two different water-retention additives (silicate granules and hydrogel) increased substrate WHC, plant available water (PAW), days until permanent wilting and growth of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) grown in green roof substrates. Two substrates were compared; one based on scoria, the other based on crushed terracotta roof-tiles. Without additives both substrates had similar WHC (40-43{\%}) but PAW was lower in scoria than in roof-tile due to greater air-filled porosity (AFP) and lower bulk density in scoria. Silicates increased WHC in both scoria and roof-tile substrates, but hydrogel only improved scoria WHC. The effects of additives on PAW differed between plant species, with additives increasing PAW in both substrates for wheat but only in roof-tile for lupins. PAW was not significantly different between hydrogel and silicates. Although hydrogels increased substrate WHC and PAW there was no increase in time until wilting in either substrate. Silicates on the other hand, increased time until wilting and total and root biomass for wheat growing in scoria and for lupins in both substrates. While there was a species effect on the efficiency of water-retention additives which requires further study, the addition of silicates is more likely to enhance species capacity to tolerate periods of low water availability on green roofs. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We used an experimental warming treatment to examine the potential influence of global warming on plant growth and interspecific interactions in a temperate steppe in northern China. Materials and methodsSix dominant plant species were grown in monoculture and all 15 two-species mixtures for one growing season under ambient and elevated temperatures in the field. Temperature was manipulated with infrared radiators. Important findingsTotal biomass of all the six plant species was increased by 34-63{\%} in monocultures and 20-76{\%} in mixtures. The magnitude of the warming effect on biomass was modified by plant interactions. Experimental warming changed the hierarchies of both competitive response and competitive effect. The competitive ability (in terms of response and effect) of one C4 grass (Pennisetum centrasiaticum) was suppressed, while the competitive abilities of one C3 forb (Artemisia capillaris) and one C3 grass (Stipa krylovii) were enhanced by experimental warming. The demonstrated alterations in growth and plant interactions may lead to changes in community structure and biodiversity in the temperate steppe in a warmer world in the future.},

Despite their far-reaching importance, we lack a general understanding of the ecological and evolutionary determinants of plant-soil feedbacks.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n2.We conducted a large-scale plant-soil feedback experiment using 49 co-occurring plant species from southern Ontario, Canada, representing a wide phylogenetic range. We tested whether effects of soil conditioning varies among these species, and whether different focal species respond similarly to the same soil conditioning. Next, we asked whether plant traits and soil feedbacks depend upon phylogenetic similarity, and which plant traits affect plant-soil feedbacks between pairs of plant species. Finally we used our experimental results to test whether soil feedbacks affect co-occurrence of species in the field.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n3.We found evidence of both strong positive and negative soil feedbacks between pairs of plant species. Our soil conditioning treatment explained nearly 20{\%} of the variation in focal species performance.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n4.Phylogenetic relatedness and phenotypic similarity between plant species were unrelated to the strength of their soil feedback. However, numerous plant traits of the conditioning species influenced the strength of soil feedbacks on focal species, including specific leaf area and total aboveground productivity. Trait differences between species were also predictive of plant-soil feedbacks, though for some pairs of species, increased trait differences were associated with positive plant-soil feedbacks and for others trait differences were associated with negative plant-soil feedbacks.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n5.Plant species co-occurrence in the field was related to their experimentally determined soil feedbacks but only for particular plant species.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n6.Synthesis. Our results illustrate how evolutionary history and phenotypic variation shape plant-soil feedbacks and highlight the need for trait-based studies. Due to the unique evolutionary history of individual traits and the variability in their importance across all possible interacting species, we show that indices of overall phenotypic and phylogenetic relatedness are poor predictors of plant-soil feedbacks at large phylogenetic scales. We conclude that a detailed trait-based approach can be used to predict plant-soil feedbacks, and laboratory measures of soil feedbacks can explain patterns of co-occurrence in nature.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Niche differentiation, assumed to be a key mechanism of species coexistence, requires that species differ in their functional traits. So far it remains unclear to which extent trait plasticity leads to niche shifts of species at higher plant diversity, thereby increasing or decreasing niche overlap between species. To analyse this question it is convenient to measure niches indirectly via the variation in resource-uptake traits rather than directly via the resources used. We provisionally call these indirectly measured niches trait-based niches. We studied shoot- and leaf-morphological characteristics in seven legume species in monoculture and multi-species mixture in experimental grassland. Legume species varied in the extent of trait variation in response to plant diversity. Trait plasticity led to significant shifts in species niches in multiple dimensions. Single-species niches in several traits associated with height growth and filling of canopy space were expanded, while other niche dimensions were compressed or did not change with plant diversity. Niche separation among legumes decreased in dimensions related to height growth and space filling, but increased in dimensions related to leaf size and morphology. The total extent of occupied niche space was larger in mixture than in the combined monocultures for dimensions related to leaf morphology and smaller for dimensions related to whole-plant architecture. Taller growth, greater space filling and greater plasticity in shoot height were positively, while larger values and greater plasticity in specific leaf area were negatively related with increased performance of species in mixture. Our study shows that trait variation in response to plant diversity shifts species niches along trait axes. Plastically increased niche differentiation is restricted to niche dimensions that are apparently not related to size-dependent differences between species, but functional equivalence (convergence in height growth) rather than complementarity (divergence in traits associated with light acquisition) explains increased performance of legumes in mixture.},

abstract = {1. The risk of pest damage in forest monocultures is a growing concern as the area of plantation forest expands world-wide and sustainable management is becoming a general goal. Numerous studies have demonstrated that pest insects are less abundant in more diverse agroecosystems, but limited experimental evidence exists for a similar relationship in forestry. Because plantation forests are usually mosaics of single-species stands, the aim of this study was to test the effect of forest diversity at a landscape level on pest insect infestations. 2. Within a stand of maritime pine, trees attacked by the stem borer Dioryctria sylvestrella showed no spatial aggregation and clusters of 66 trees proved to be an optimal sampling unit for determining overall percentage infestation. 3. The spatial distribution of stem borer infestation levels was examined in three maritime pine stands bordered by mixed-species stands of broad-leaved trees, and overall infestation levels compared between four such maritime pine stands and four other maritime pine stands of the same structure but far from any broad-leaved stands. 4. The percentage of trees infested was significantly lower in the pine stands bordered by broad-leaved stands than in the pine stands surrounded by other pine stands, and in the former, stem borer infestation showed a significant logistic increase with distance from the stand edge. This could be due to effects of resource concentration or natural enemy attack, both of which are discussed. 5. These results suggest that the conservation or restoration of non-productive mixed-species stands adjacent to intensively managed plantations is a useful preventive method for pest management in forest monocultures.},

@article{dias_experimental_2013,
abstract = {* There is a growing consensus that the distribution of species trait values in a community can greatly determine ecosystem processes and services delivery. Two distinct components of community trait composition are hypothesized to chiefly affect ecosystem processes: (i) the average trait value of the species, quantified by community-weighted mean trait values (CWM; related to the mass ratio hypothesis) and (ii) the degree to which trait values differ between species in a community, quantified by different indices of functional diversity (FD; related to non-additive community effects). The uncertainty on the relative effect of these two components is stimulating an increasing number of empirical studies testing their effects on ecosystem processes and services delivery.

* We suggest, however, that the interdependence between CWM and FD poses a challenge on disentangling their relative importance. We present a framework that allows designing experiments to decouple and assess the effects of these two community functional components on ecosystem processes and services. To illustrate the framework, we focused on leaf litter decomposition, as this is an essential process related to important ecosystem services. Using simulations, we applied the framework for plant leaf litter traits (litter nitrogen and phenolic content) that are related to litter decomposition.

* CWM and FD generally showed a hump-shaped relationship (i.e. at more extreme CWM values, communities can have only low FD values). Within this relationship, we showed that it is possible to select quasi-orthogonal combinations of CWM and FD that can be treated statistically. Within these orthogonal CWM and FD combinations, it is also possible to select species assemblages controlling for other community parameters, such as total biomass, total density and species richness.

* Synthesis. The framework provides a novel approach for designing experiments to decouple the effects of CWM and FD of communities on ecosystem processes, which otherwise cannot be easily disentangled. To apply the framework and design proper experimental layouts, it is essential to have a priori knowledge of the key traits by which species affect ecosystem processes and service delivery.},

abstract = {1.Niche complementarity and competitive disparity are driving mechanisms behind plant community assembly and productivity. Consequently, there is great interest in predicting species complementarity and their competitive differences from their functional traits as dissimilar species may compete less and result in more complete use of resources. 2.Here we assessed the role of trait dissimilarities on species complementarity and competitive disparities within an experimental gradient of plant species richness and functional trait dissimilarity. Communities were assembled using three pools of grass and forb species based on a priori knowledge of traits related to (1) above- and belowground spatial differences in resource acquisition, (2) phenological differences, or (3) both. Complementarity and competitive disparities were assessed by partitioning the overyielding in mixed species communities into species complementarity and dominance effects. 3.Community overyielding and the underlying complementarity and competitive dominance varied strongly among the three plant species pools. Overyielding and complementarity was greatest among species that were assembled based on their variation in both spatial and phenological traits. Competitive dominance was greatest when species were assembled based on spatial resource-acquisition traits alone. 4.In communities that were assembled based on species variation in only spatial or phenological traits greater competitive dominance was predicted by greater differences SLA and flowering initiation respectively, while greater complementarity was predicted by greater dissimilarity in leaf area and flowering senescence, respectively. Greater differences in leaf area could also be linked to greater species complementarity in communities assembled based on variation in both phenological and spatial traits, but trait dissimilarity was unrelated to competitive dominance in these communities. 5.Our results indicate that complementarity and competitive disparity among species are both driven by trait dissimilarities. However, the identity of the traits that drives the complementarity and competitive disparity depends on the trait variation among species that comprise the community. Moreover, we demonstrate that communities assembled with the greater variation in both spatial and phenological traits show the greatest complementarity among species.

* 2Measurements of root morphology, architecture, nitrogen and phenolic concentration, respiration and phosphorus uptake were taken on fine, non-woody roots sampled from forest stands in central Pennsylvania, USA.
* 3Across all five contrasts, roots of fast-growing species generally had higher specific root length, smaller diameters, greater degree of branching, and lower phenolic concentrations than those of slow-growing species. This suggests differences in potential soil exploration and root defences among species differing in potential growth rate.
* 4There were no significant differences between fast- and slow-growing species in root tissue density, respiration or P uptake. Lack of root physiological differences between species differing in growth rate contrasted with previous research on chamber-grown seedlings.
* 5These results imply that, while roots of fast-growing species may be constructed for more rapid soil exploration and shorter life span than those of slow-growing species, root physiology is either more closely tied to overall plant physiology, which is more similar among mature trees, or masked by variation in soil microsites, root age or interactions with mycorrhizal fungi.},

To this aim, MFC were implemented in a pilot plant based on two HSSF CW, one fed with primary settled wastewater (Settler line) and the other fed with the effluent of a hydrolytic up-flow sludge blanket reactor (HUSB line). The eubacterial and archaeal community was profiled on wetland gravel, MFC electrodes and primary treated wastewater by means of 16S rRNA gene-based 454-pyrosequencing and qPCR of 16S rRNA and mcrA genes. Maximum current (219 mA/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and power (36 mW/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) densities were obtained for the HUSB line. Power production pattern correlated well with water level fluctuations within the wetlands, whereas the type of primary treatment implemented had a significant impact on the diversity and relative abundance of eubacteria communities colonizing MFC. It is worth noticing the high predominance (13-16{\%} of relative abundance) of one OTU belonging to Geobacter on active MFC of the HUSB line that was absent for the settler line MFC.

Area of study: The definition is developed in Europe but can be tested worldwide. Material and methods: Review of existent definitions of mixed forests based and literature review encompassing dynamics, management and economic valuation of mixed forests. Main results: A mixed forest is defined as a forest unit, excluding linear formations, where at least two tree species coexist at any developmental stage, sharing common resources (light, water, and/or soil nutrients). The presence of each of the component species is normally quantified as a proportion of the number of stems or of basal area, although volume, biomass or canopy cover as well as proportions by occupied stand area may be used for specific objectives. A variety of structures and patterns of mixtures can occur, and the interactions between the component species and their relative proportions may change over time. The research perspectives identified are (i) species interactions and responses to hazards, (ii) the concept of maximum density in mixed forests, (iii) conversion of monocultures to mixed-species forest and (iv) economic valuation of ecosystem services provided by mixed forests. Research highlights: The definition is considered a high-level one which encompasses previous attempts to define mixed forests.

abstract = {Arid environments are characterized by limited and variable rainfall that supplies resources in pulses. Resource pulsing is a special form of environmental variation, and the general theory of coexistence in variable environments suggests specific mechanisms by which rainfall variability might contribute to the maintenance of high species diversity in arid ecosystems. In this review, we discuss physiological, morphological, and life-history traits that facilitate plant survival and growth in strongly water-limited variable environments, outlining how species differences in these traits may promote diversity. Our analysis emphasizes that the variability of pulsed environments does not reduce the importance of species interactions in structuring communities, but instead provides axes of ecological differentiation between species that facilitate their coexistence. Pulses of rainfall also influence higher trophic levels and entire food webs. Better understanding of how rainfall affects the diversity, species composition, and dynamics of arid environments can contribute to solving environmental problems stemming from land use and global climate change.},

abstract = {The diversity of life is ultimately generated by evolution, and much attention has focused on the rapid evolution of ecological traits. Yet, the tendency for many ecological traits to instead remain similar over time [niche conservatism (NC)] has many consequences for the fundamental patterns and processes studied in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we describe the mounting evidence for the importance of NC to major topics in ecology (e.g. species richness, ecosystem function) and conservation (e.g. climate change, invasive species). We also review other areas where it may be important but has generally been overlooked, in both ecology (e.g. food webs, disease ecology, mutualistic interactions) and conservation (e.g. habitat modification). We summarize methods for testing for NC, and suggest that a commonly used and advocated method (involving a test for phylogenetic signal) is potentially problematic, and describe alternative approaches. We suggest that considering NC: (1) focuses attention on the within-species processes that cause traits to be conserved over time, (2) emphasizes connections between questions and research areas that are not obviously related (e.g. invasives, global warming, tropical richness), and (3) suggests new areas for research (e.g. why are some clades largely nocturnal? why do related species share diseases?).},

abstract = {This study investigated the establishment of annual meadow including native and non-native species in an extensive green roof in Sheffield, UK. The study aimed to determine the feasibility of establishing annual plant species from a seed mixture and to determine the appropriate sowing rate as well as the necessity of watering during the first growing season from June to November 2006. A 22-species seed mixture was sown on an experimental green roof with a substrate depth of 7cm using two sowing rates (2g/m2and 4g/m2) and two watering regimes (with and without watering). The watering regime consisted of application of water four times over the course of the experiment. Each combination of sowing and watering regime yielded a successful aesthetic annual meadow green roof. Results showed that a low sowing rate resulted in better conditions for individual plant growth when enough water was available. On the other hand, a high sowing rate was necessary to ensure a sufficient number of plants when water resources were not abundant. The watering regime improved growth in most species; however, it was determined that an annual seed mixture could perform well without watering at the study site. The annual meadow possessed an abundance of flowering plants for an extended period of time; plants started flowering one month after sowing and continued until the end of October. Successful species during the first growing season included Alyssum maritimum, Echium plantagineum 'Blue Bedder', Gypsophila muralis, Iberis amara, Iberis umbellata 'Fairy', Linaria elegans and Linaria maroccana. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1 If different factors inhibiting plant growth, e.g. low rainfall or low soil nutrients, were to select for species that have similar constellations of traits, then the unfavourable factors might usefully be grouped together as 'stress'. 2 We offer a method for assessing this issue. A species mixture at a site is described by a point on a plane with two traits as axes. Change along an environmental gradient is then represented as a trajectory across the trait-plane. Trajectories along different environmental gradients are compared. 3 We measured leaf width, specific leaf area (SLA) and mature canopy height for the 386 perennial species found at 46 sites spread along rainfall and soil total phosphorus gradients in south-eastern Australia. Each trait was lognormally distributed across species within sites, hence the mean of log10(trait) satisfactorily described the species mixture at each site. 4 Combinations of assemblage-mean leaf width with SLA followed similar trajectories as rainfall and soil total P decreased. For these traits in this setting, the method indicated that low rainfall and low soil P favour similar trait-combinations. 5 Mature plant height also decreased along both rainfall and soil P gradients, and thus was positively correlated with leaf width and SLA at the level of assemblage means. The rainfall trajectories involving height behaved differently from the soil P trajectories, especially at rainfalls below c. 400 mm year22121, where assemblage-mean height declined much further than at low soil P. 6 Across all species, traits were only very loosely correlated (r2 from 0.04 to 0.17). For leaf width and SLA, evolutionary divergences were positively correlated, both before and after cross-correlation with divergence in rainfall and soil P was removed. This latter measures evolutionary divergence correlation within habitat. For height the picture was more complicated. Considering these within-habitat divergence correlations, species that were taller at maturity tended to have lower SLA and leaf width. This pattern is the reverse of the broad geographical correlation of assemblage means, showing that the patterns across assemblages result from species being selectively sifted from the regional flora into sites, not from evolutionary or cross-species correlations. 7 The trait-combination trajectory approach showed some commonalities between low soil nutrient and low rainfall habitats with regard to traits favoured in species occurring there, but also some differences. The approach has potential for clarifying which environmental factors can usefully be grouped together as 'stress', and which trait combinations can usefully be regarded as part of a syndrome favoured by stress.},

abstract = {Stormwater biofilters are important tools for managing runoff in urban watersheds. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no accounts examining the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters. This plant–fungi relationship is an important interaction in most terrestrial ecosystems, playing a role in nutrient dynamics, water cycling, and soil organic matter decomposition. The presence of mycorrhiza in biofilters could have implications for nutrient and metal uptake in plants, and thus enhance removal of target pollutants. Additionally, the establishment, growth, and survivability of plants could be enhanced when roots are colonized by mycorrhizae. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters of varying ages in three Australian cities: Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. The 32 biofilters surveyed supported 56 plant species, with dominant species belonging to the Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, Juncaceae, Onagraceae, Poaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae families. Mycorrhizal associations were identified from 4 of the 11 most dominant plant species from 9 different biofilters, but relatively low percentages of mycorrhizal colonization (3–25{\%} colonization) were observed in biofilter plant roots. Mycorrhizal colonization was not related to biofilter age. These results demonstrate that mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant roots growing in biofilters. These findings provide useful evidence of the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in stormwater biofilters that support subsequent investigation into their roles in these systems.},

abstract = {Stormwater control measures (SCMs) such as constructed stormwater ponds and constructed stormwater wetlands (CSWs) are designed to regulate runoff hydrology and quality. However, these created ecosystems also provide a range of other benefits, or ecosystem services, which are often acknowledged but rarely quantified. In this study, additional ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and cultural services, were assessed and compared between 20 ponds and 20 CSWs in North Carolina, USA. Carbon sequestration was estimated through the carbon content of pond and wetland sediments across a gradient of system age. Biodiversity was quantified in terms of the richness and Shannon diversity index of vegetative and aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Cultural services were qualitatively assessed based on the potential for recreational and educational opportunities at each site. Ponds and wetlands were found to support similar levels of macroinvertebrate diversity, though differences community composition arose between the two habitat types. CSWs demonstrated greater potential to provide carbon sequestration, vegetative diversity, and cultural ecosystem services. This assessment provides an initial framework upon which future assessments of ecosystem service provision by SCMs can build. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Ecologists use plant species traits as generic predictors of geographical distribution, interactions with other species, and ecosystem functioning, but this approach has been little used to optimize engineered ecosystems. Four plant species traits (height, individual leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) were evaluated as predictors of ecosystem properties and services in a modular green roof system planted with 21 species. Six indicators of ecosystem services, incorporating thermal, hydrological, water quality, and carbon sequestration functions, were predicted by the four plant traits directly or indirectly via their effects on aggregate ecosystem properties, including canopy density and albedo. Species average height and specific leaf area were the most useful traits, predicting several services via effects on canopy density or growth rate. This study demonstrates that easily measured plant traits can be used to select species to optimize green roof performance across multiple key services.},

abstract = {1. The mechanisms controlling soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) accumulation are crucial for explaining why soils are major terrestrial C sinks. Such mechanisms have been mainly addressed by imposing short-term, step-changes in CO 2 , temperature and N fertilization rates on either monocultures or low-diversity plant assemblages. No studies have addressed the long-term effects of plant functional diversity (i.e. plant functional composition) on rates of soil C accumulation in N-limited grasslands where fixation is the main source of N for plants. 2. Here we measure net soil C and N accumulation to 1 m soil-depth during a 12-year-long grassland biodiversity experiment established on agriculturally degraded soils at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, USA. 3. We show that high-diversity mixtures of perennial grassland plant species stored 500{\%} and 600{\%} more soil C and N than, on average, did monoculture plots of the same species. More- over, the presence of C4 grasses and legumes increased soil C accumulation by 193{\%} and 522{\%}, respectively. Higher soil C and N accrual resulted both from increased C and N inputs via (i) higher root biomass, and (ii) from greater root biomass accumulation to 60 cm soil depth resulting from the presence of highly complementary functional groups (i.e. C4 grasses and legumes). 4. Our results suggest that the joint presence of C4 grass and legume species is a key cause of greater soil C and N accumulation in both higher and lower diversity plant assemblages. This is because legumes have unique access to N, and C4 grasses take up and use N efficiently, increasing below-ground biomass and thus soil C and N inputs. 5. Synthesis. We demonstrate that plant functional complementarity is a key reason why higher plant diversity leads to greater soil C and N accumulation on agriculturally degraded soils. We suggest the combination of key C4 grass–legume species may greatly increase ecosystem services such as soil C accumulation and biomass (biofuel) production in both high- and low-diversity N-limited grassland systems.},

abstract = {* Plant invasions can be promoted by environmental heterogeneity, but the opposite effect, the impact of plant invasion on heterogeneity, has received little attention. Grassland invasions might contribute to decreased spatial heterogeneity because invaders tend to be larger than native vegetation. Lowered heterogeneity may contribute to the low diversity of invaded communities, as well as to the persistence of invasive populations. * We compared the spatial heterogeneity of roots and resources in uninvaded native grassland and in stands invaded by a relatively large exotic grass (Agropyron cristatum), in four combinations of mowing and nitrogen (N) addition. We focused on roots because they account for the majority of primary production in grasslands. * The spatial heterogeneity of root length (m root m−2 rhizotron image) and root production was significantly lower beneath A. cristatum than uninvaded grassland. This result was consistent in all combinations of mowing and N addition. * Beneath the invader, root length was significantly greater, and the proportion of samples that contained roots was significantly higher. This suggests that the invader decreased spatial heterogeneity by more completely filling the soil volume with roots. * Resource heterogeneity varied significantly between vegetation types in just one of four cases examined, suggesting that invader effects on resource heterogeneity were small relative to its effects on root heterogeneity. * These results suggest a novel mechanism promoting invader success and persistence: high root heterogeneity, lower root length and empty soil volumes in native grassland may make it relatively vulnerable to invasion, while reduced heterogeneity and greater root length in invaded grasslands may sustain stable, low-diversity communities dominated by the invader. Lowered heterogeneity accompanying invasion may partly account for the wide-spread occurrence of low-diversity, invader-dominated grasslands in North America.},

abstract = {Species enter and persist in local communities because of their ecological fit to local conditions, and recently, ecologists have moved from measuring diversity as species richness and evenness, to using measures that reflect species ecological differences. There are two principal approaches for quantifying species ecological differences: functional (trait-based) and phylogenetic pairwise distances between species. Both approaches have produced new ecological insights, yet at the same time methodological issues and assumptions limit them. Traits and phylogeny may provide different, and perhaps complementary, information about species' differences. To adequately test assembly hypotheses, a framework integrating the information provided by traits and phylogenies is required. We propose an intuitive measure for combining functional and phylogenetic pairwise distances, which provides a useful way to assess how functional and phylogenetic distances contribute to understanding patterns of community assembly. Here, we show that both traits and phylogeny inform community assembly patterns in alpine plant communities across an elevation gradient, because they represent complementary information. Differences in historical selection pressures have produced variation in the strength of the trait-phylogeny correlation, and as such, integrating traits and phylogeny can enhance the ability to detect assembly patterns across habitats or environmental gradients.},

abstract = {Aim of the study: An experiment was established in 1966 to compare the growth and development of 50: 50 mixtures of Sitka spruce ( Picea sitchensis ) with either Japanese larch ( Larix kaempferi ) or tamarack ( L. laricina ) with that found in pure plots of Sitka spruce. The site was one of moderate nitrogen availability where the presence of heather ( Calluna vulgaris ) could be expected to limit the growth ofSitka spruce. Area of the study: North-east Scotland. Material and methods : There were different patterns of spruce growth in the pure plots and in the mixtures, with faster spruce growth in mixture in the years approaching and immediately following canopy closure (i.e. ages 15-25). Foliage analysis suggested that this was linked with improved nitrogen status of spruce trees in the mixed compared to the pure plots. Main results : At years 20 and 25 there were significant differences in height, diameter, and basal area between treatments, with the largest basal area being found in the Japanese larch/Sitka spruce mixtures, indicative of overyielding in the mixed plots. However, when the experiment was clearfelled at 41 years of age, all treatments had self-thinned to produce spruce dominated stands of similar height with only an occasional larch tree surviving in plots that were originally 50:50 mixtures. Research highlights : There were no differences between treatments in basal area, harvested volume or sawlog outturn after 41 years. These results can be interpreted as showing facilitation between the larch and the spruce during the establishment phase followed by competition for light once canopy closure had occurred. Keywords : Mixed stand dynamics; facilitation; nitrogen status; product outturn.},

abstract = {Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

abstract = {In 1955, an experiment was established at Gisburn forest in northern England to compare the performance of pure and mixed plots of four species: Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa). At the end of the first rotation, there was enhanced growth in all mixtures with Scots pine while there was a negative interaction in the Norway spruce/sessile oak mixture. The experiment was felled in 1989 after windblow and replanted in 1991, when Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) was added to the species trialled. After 20 years of the second rotation, patterns of individual species growth were generally similar to those in the first rotation, except that height and diameter growth of Norway spruce and Scots pine was significantly greater (P {\textless} 0.01) in mixed plots. Basal area growth of three combinations (Sitka spruce/Scots pine; Norway spruce/Scots pine; Norway spruce/common alder) was about 40 per cent greater than (and significantly different from) that predicted from performance in pure plots of the same species, evidence of transgressive overyielding. These results indicate that facilitation effects through improved nutrient status can lead to better productivity in mixed-species stands in planted forests. The implications of these findings for policies seeking to diversify single species planted forests are considered.},

abstract = {To predict the ecological consequences of biodiversity loss, researchers have spent much time and effort quantifying how biological variation affects the magnitude and stability of ecological processes that underlie the functioning of ecosystems. Here we add to this work by looking at how biodiversity jointly impacts two aspects of ecosystem functioning at once: (1) the production of biomass at any single point in time (biomass/area or biomass/ volume), and (2) the stability of biomass production through time (the CV of changes in total community biomass through time). While it is often assumed that biodiversity simultaneously enhances both of these aspects of ecosystem functioning, the joint distribution of data describing how species richness regulates productivity and stability has yet to be quantified. Furthermore, analyses have yet to examine how diversity effects on production covary with diversity effects on stability. To overcome these two gaps, we reanalyzed the data from 34 experiments that have manipulated the richness of terrestrial plants or aquatic algae and measured how this aspect of biodiversity affects community biomass at multiple time points. Our reanalysis confirms that biodiversity does indeed simultaneously enhance both the production and stability of biomass in experimental systems, and this is broadly true for terrestrial and aquatic primary producers. However, the strength of diversity effects on biomass production is independent of diversity effects on temporal stability. The independence of effect sizes leads to two important conclusions. First, while it may be generally true that biodiversity enhances both productivity and stability, it is also true that the highest levels of productivity in a diverse community are not associated with the highest levels of stability. Thus, on average, diversity does not maximize the various aspects of ecosystem functioning we might wish to achieve in conservation and management. Second, knowing how biodiversity affects productivity gives no information about how diversity affects stability (or vice versa). Therefore, to predict the ecological changes that occur in ecosystems after extinction, we will need to develop separate mechanistic models for each independent aspect of ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {The relationship between on-farm avian conservation measures and the potential provisioning of pest-control services by birds is poorly understood in intensive agricultural landscapes, especially in temperate regions. We used an exclusion experiment to test the effects of field- and landscape-scale habitat complexity on avian-provisioned pest-control services and assessed avian abundance and diversity across 32 conventional alfalfa (Medicago sativa) fields in winter and early spring in California. Alfalfa is a key forage crop around the world and is grown on approximately 30 million hectares globally each year. Bird foraging reduced the abundance of the most significant insect pests of alfalfa by over 33{\%}. The presence of complex edge habitat (presence of at least two trees {\textgreater}1.5 m) led to higher avian abundance within fields, which in turn led to reduced pest insect populations at sampling points close to the field edge. Fields with complex edge habitat also harbored nearly three times as many bird species as those with simple edge habitat. The distance from the nearest riparian habitat, a measure of landscape diversity, did not affect bird abundance or diversity in winter alfalfa fields, which may be related to the homogenous landscape in which our study was based. Our results show that relatively simple conservation measures in intensively managed farming landscapes, such as planting small trees along a field edge, can result in increased abundance and diversity of over-wintering birds, with direct benefits to farmers through increased avian-mediated pest-control services.},

abstract = {Constructed wetlands (CW) are considered a successful tool to treat wastewater in many countries: their success is mainly assessed observing the rate of pollution reduction, but CW can also contribute to the conservation of ecosystem services. Among the many ecosystem services provided, the biodiversity of CW has received less attention. The EcoSistema Filtro (ESF) of the Molentargius-Saline Regional Natural Park is a constructed wetland situated in Sardinia (Italy), built to filter treated wastewater, increase habitat diversity, and enhance local biodiversity. A floristic survey has been carried out yearly 1 year after the construction of the artificial ecosystem in 2004, observing the modification of the vascular flora composition in time. The flora of the ESF accounted for 54 {\%} of the whole Regional Park's flora; alien species amount to 12 {\%}; taxa of conservation concern are 6 {\%}. Comparing the data in the years, except for the biennium 2006/2007, we observed a continuous increase of species richness, together with an increase of endemics, species of conservation concern, and alien species too. Once the endemics appeared, they remained part of the flora, showing a good persistence in the artificial wetland. Included in a natural park, but trapped in a sprawling and fast growing urban context, this artificial ecosystem provides multiple uses, by preserving and enhancing biodiversity. This is particularly relevant considering that biodiversity can act as a driver of sustainable development in urban areas where most of the world's population lives and comes into direct contact with nature.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Factorial manipulations of biodiversity on different trophic levels can reveal the mechanisms that govern how biomass is partitioned within and among trophic levels. Here I report results of a laboratory microcosm experiment crossing eight algal compositions (seven monocultures and a polyculture of all seven species) with five ciliate herbivore compositions (no herbivores, three monocultures, and a polyculture of all three species). Microcosms allowed comparison of short-, medium-, and long-term (dozens of generations) results. Niche differentiation allowed competing algae to coexist in the absence of herbi-vores. Surprisingly, algal polycultures produced more biomass than the most productive monocultures only in the medium term. A temporally variable relationship between the productivity of diverse and depauparate algal assemblages might reflect changes in com-petitive mechanisms over time, and/or transient dynamics, and contrasts with the predictions of simple competition models. Herbivores had little effect on total algal biomass or algal composition, in part because of the lack of a strong trade-off between algal competitive ability and edibility. Increasing algal diversity significantly reduced the biomass of one herbivore, apparently because com-petition from inedible algae reduced the productivity of edible algae. A negative effect of inedible algae on herbivore biomass accords with simple food web theory and indicates that increasing diversity on one trophic level can have negative consequences for other trophic levels. Herbivores varied little in their abilities to graze different algae. Total algal biomass, algal composition, and total herbivore biomass were independent of herbivore diversity and composition, and algal composition had only minor effects the outcome of competition among herbivores. However, the outcome of herbivore competition was predictably asym-metrical, indicating that herbivores varied in other ways, such as ability to consume alter-native food sources (bacteria). Further factorial manipulations of diversity and trophic structure are needed to improve understanding of the likely consequences of species loss in food webs. These experiments should last as long as possible, since the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem properties may depend as much on when the relation-ship is measured as on species identity and the degree of niche differentiation among species.},

abstract = {Diverse plant communities are predicted to have higher abundance of predators as compared to species-poor ones. In this study we explored whether this prediction holds true for the abundance of predatory arthropods in forest ecosystems, which have been poorly studied in this respect. We collected ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall traps from six long-term forest diversity experiments in Finland, Sweden and UK. The effects of tree species diversity on abundance of five main groups of predatory arthropods (ants, spiders, carabids, staphylinids and opilionids) were examined by means of meta-analysis. Overall, the diversity of tree species did not affect abundances of predators with the exception of staphylinids, which were more abundant in mixed stands than in monocultures. However, the effects of stand diversity on predator abundance became apparent when analyses were conducted on tree species basis. Preference for stands containing particular tree species was clear in the case of opilionids, carabids and staphylinids, and these preferences overruled the effects of tree species diversity in comparisons between monocultures and mixed stands containing the same tree species. Tree species diversity effects on predator abundance were furthermore mediated by the tree age, plot size and planting density used in the experiment. Overall, our results show that predator abundance does not increase uniformly with increase in tree species diversity, but rather suggest that predators have distinct preferences for stands composed of particular tree species and that these species preferences may overrule the effects of diversity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although plant diversity is postulated to resist invasion, studies have not provided consistent results, most of which were ascribed to the influences of other covariate environmental factors. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To explore the mechanisms by which plant diversity influences community invasibility, an experiment was conducted involving grassland sites varying in their species richness (one, two, four, eight, and sixteen species). Light interception efficiency and soil resources (total N, total P, and water content) were measured. The number of species, biomass, and the number of seedlings of the invading species decreased significantly with species richness. The presence of Patrinia scabiosaefolia Fisch. ex Trev. and Mosla dianthera (Buch.-Ham. ex Roxburgh) Maxim. significantly increased the resistance of the communities to invasion. A structural equation model showed that the richness of planted species had no direct and significant effect on invasion. Light interception efficiency had a negative effect on the invasion whereas soil water content had a positive effect. In monocultures, Antenoron filiforme (Thunb.) Rob. et Vaut. showed the highest light interception efficiency and P. scabiosaefolia recorded the lowest soil water content. With increased planted-species richness, a greater percentage of pots showed light use efficiency higher than that of A. filiforme and a lower soil water content than that in P. scabiosaefolia. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study suggest that plant diversity confers resistance to invasion, which is mainly ascribed to the sampling effect of particular species and the complementarity effect among species on resources use.},

abstract = {Species and functional group (grasses, legumes, creeping nonlegume forbs, rosette nonlegume forbs) richness of species assemblages composed of 16 species from four functional plant groups were manipulated to evaluate the productivity-diversity relationships in a greenhouse pot experiment. Pots were filled with sand, and supplied at two levels of nutrients. The plants were grown in monocultures, two, four, eight and 16 species mixtures. Individual two, four, and eight species mixtures differed in the richness of functional groups. Although the two characteristics of biodiversity, i.e. species and functional group richness, were necessarily correlated, it was shown that it is possible to separate their effect statistically, and also test for their common effect without pronounced loss of test power. There was a pronounced increase of average aboveground biomass and a mild increase in belowground biomass with biodiversity. The effect of functional group richness was more pronounced than the effect of the number of species. By using the method of Loreau and Hector (Nature 411 (2001) 72), selection and complementarity effects were statistically separated, and the overyielding index was calculated as a ratio of the productivity of a mixture to the productivity of its most productive component (to demonstrate transgressive overyielding). Positive values of complementarity and transgressive overyielding were both found, particularly in some rich communities and under high nutrient levels. Complementarity significantly increased only with functional group richness and mainly under high nutrients in the belowground biomass. Some species, when grown in monocultures, had decreased productivity under higher nutrients, and thus were more productive in mixtures than in monocultures. It seems that those species suffered from too high nutrient levels when grown in monocultures, but not in the presence of other species, which were able to use the nutrients in high concentrations and effectively decrease the nutrient levels. As a consequence, mixtures of high diversity were always more productive under high nutrients. The difference in species proportions between high and low nutrients, characterized by chord distance, increased with species richness. The relative change in productivity decreased with the number of functional groups. This suggests that species richness might lead to stabilization of aggregate characteristics (like total productivity) under changing environmental conditions by changing the proportions of individual species. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier SAS.

Yet, how the diversity–productivity relationship depends on species identity and abiotic conditions remains a challenging issue. 2. We analysed mixture effects on species productivity along site productivity gradients, calculated from a set of abiotic factors, in two biogeographic contexts (highlands and lowlands). We compared the productivity of 5 two-species mixtures (i.e. 10 cases of mixed species) with that of monocultures of the same species. Five main European tree species were considered: sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), silver fir(Abies alba Mill.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst). 3. Our data set was compiled from the 2006 to 2010 French National Forest Inventory data base and covers 2361 plots including pure and mixed stands. 4. Overall productivity of mixtures in highlands, that is European beech–Norway spruce, European beech–silver fir and to a lesser extent, silver fir–Norway spruce, was found to be higher than expected from the productivity of corresponding monospecific stands. Overyielding was mainly due to European beech for the first two mixtures and to silver fir for the third one. 5. No effect of mixture was found for sessile oak–Scots pine and sessile oak–European beech stands in lowlands. Overyielding of sessile oak mixed with Scots pine was not strong enough to signifi- cantly increase overall stand productivity. Overyielding of European beech was balanced by an un- deryielding of sessile oak. 6. The mixture effect changed along site productivity gradients for six cases out of the 10 studied, with a stronger and positive effect on sites with low productivity. The magnitude of this change along site productivity gradients varied up to 89{\%} depending on the tree species. 7. Synthesis. The nature of species interaction in mixtures with regard to productivity changes with species assemblage and abiotic conditions. Overyielding is strongest when species grow in highlands on less productive sites. A negative link between mixture effect and site productivity was found, in line with the stress-gradient hypothesis},

abstract = {Planting multiple species in wetland restoration sites could potentially accelerate ecological succession while enhancing ecological services. Our study of thick-mat floating marsh demonstrated that two species performed better than monocultures for developing a more structurally sound root mat. Although Panicum hemitomon is the typical dominant and focal species of all restoration efforts of this habitat type, we evaluated the effects of additional species, including Sagittaria lancifolia, a ubiquitous floating marsh constituent, and three laterally growing specialists (Alternanthera philoxeroides, Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, and Ludwigia peploides). In a mesocosm experiment, we found greater P. hemitomon biomass in monocultures but greater vegetative cover and total mat biomass with P. hemitomon plus L. peploides, but not greater biomass in the most species-rich treatment or treatment with the greatest initial planting density. We conclude that L. peploides aids restoration of thick-mat floating marsh by increasing mat buoyancy, enhancing lateral growth, and providing greater root mat structural integrity. This type of laterally growing specialist should accelerate coalescence of neighboring constructed and naturally formed mats. Planting species that occupy complementary niches should also minimize competition for key resources.},

abstract = {Urbanisation is considered an important driver of current biodiversity loss, but the underlying causes are not fully understood. It is generally assumed that this loss reflects the fact that most organisms do not tolerate well the environmental alterations associated with urbanisation. Nevertheless, current evidence is inconclusive and the alternative that the biodiversity loss is the result of random mechanisms has never been evaluated. Analysing changes in abundance between urbanised environments and their non-urbanised surroundings of {\textgreater} 800 avian species from five continents, we show here that although random processes account for part of the species loss associated with urbanisation, much of the loss is associated with a lack of appropriate adaptations of most species for exploiting resources and avoiding risks of the urban environments. These findings have important conservation implications because the extinction of species with particular features should have higher impact on biodiversity and ecosystem function than a random loss.},

Here, we asked whether genotypic diversity in the herb Ruellia nudiflora influences seed predator (SP) and parasitoid functional responses, and if such effects in turn influence selection on the plant. We established plots with plants of one or five genetic families (pool = 14) and measured fruit, seed predator, and parasitoid abundance.

abstract = {Spatial and temporal niche differentiation are potential mechanisms of plant species' coexistence in many communities, including many grasslands. In a 6-year field experiment, a dominant prairie bunchgrass, Schizachyrium scoparium, excluded species sharing similar phenology and rooting depth, but coexisted with species differing in phenology and rooting depth. We used a series of experimental plots that differed in S. scoparium abundance to measure the effect of S. scoparium on abundances of other species and on soil nitrate concentrations across time and depth. Because we found that S. scoparium most strongly reduced soil nitrate levels at mid-season and at shallow depths, we hypothesized that at higher S. scoparium abundance, species with mid-season phenology and shallow roots would be excluded and that deep-rooted and early season species would be more likely to persist. As predicted, the proportional number and cover of species exploiting different niches than S. scoparium (early season and deep-rooted species) increased across the S. scoparium abundance gradient. This work provides novel empirical evidence for the factors that contribute to species coexistence in the field. Our study suggests that spatial and temporal niche differentiation promote species coexistence in these grasslands.},

abstract = {Sulfate in effluent is a challenging issue for wastewater reuse around the world. In this study, sulfur (S) removal and transformation in five batch constructed wetlands (CWs) treating secondary effluent were investigated. The results showed that the presence of the plant cattail (Typha latifolia) had little effect on sulfate removal, while the carbon-rich litter it generated greatly improved sulfate removal, but with limited sulfide accumulation in the pore-water. After sulfate removal, most of the S was deposited with the valence states S (-II) and S (0) on the iron-rich gravel surface, and acid volatile sulfide was the main S sink in the litter-added CWs. High-throughput pyrosequencing revealed that sulfate-reducing bacteria (i.e. Desulfobacter) and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (i.e. Thiobacillus) were dominant in the litter-added CWs, which led to a sustainable S cycle between sulfate and sulfide. Overall, this study suggests that recycling plant litter and iron-rich filling material in CWs gives an opportunity to utilize the S in the wastewater as both an electron acceptor for sulfate reduction and as an electron donor for nitrate reduction coupled with sulfide oxidation. This leads to the simultaneous removal of sulfate, nitrate, and organics without discharging toxic sulfide into the receiving water body.},

abstract = {A large-scale laboratory study was conducted to test the influence of design and operating conditions on the lifespan of stormwater biofilters. The evolution of hydraulic conductivity over time was studied in relation to a number of key design parameters (media type, filter depth, vegetation type, system sizing, etc). The biofilters were observed to clog over time, with average hydraulic conductivity decreasing by a factor of 3.6 over the 72 weeks of testing. The choice of plant species appears to have a significant effect on the rate of decrease in permeability, with plants with thick roots (e.g. Melaleuca) demonstrating an ability to maintain permeability over time. Other species studied, with finer roots, had no such beneficial effects. As expected, small systems relative to their catchment (and thus which are subjected to high loading rates) are more prone to clogging, as increases in hydraulic and sediment loading can lead to extremely low hydraulic conductivities. Sizing and the appropriate choice of vegetation are thus key elements in design because they can limit clogging, and therefore, indirectly increase annual load treated by limiting the volume of water bypassing the system. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Generalizations regarding the mechanisms underlying the effects of plant diversity on ecosystem processes, and whether the patterns transcend study systems remain elusive. Many terrestrial plant diversity manipulations have found that plant biomass increases with diversity, but most marine studies find little or no effect of seaweed diversity on producer biomass or production. However, differences in experimental approach (field vs. mesocosm) and duration (years vs. weeks) between published terrestrial and marine experiments confound the interpretation of these differences in response to changing diversity. We conducted a three-year field manipulation of seaweed diversity on intertidal rocky reefs in central California, USA, to examine the effect of diversity on seaweed cover. We found that diversity increased standing algal cover and decreased the availability of free space relative to monocultures, but this effect took nine months to materialize. Furthermore, diverse assemblages did not consistently exceed the best performing monocultures until 18 months after the experiment was initiated, suggesting that the effect of diversity strengthens over time. Overall, diversity's effect was consistently stronger than that of individual species and not attributable to the influence of any particular species (sampling effect) because (1) polycultures$\backslash$r$\backslash$neventually achieved higher cover than even the best performing monoculture and (2) monocultures rarely differed much, precluding a strong sampling effect. Instead, mechanisms such as facilitation and differential use of microhabitats in a heterogeneous environment likely caused the higher cover in polycultures. Our findings contrast with short-term experiments with other seaweeds but are similar to longer-term experiments with terrestrial plants, suggesting that experimental design and approach, rather than inherent differences between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, underlie contrasting responses among systems. We argue that experiments conducted in the field, and for a greater length of time, allow for the manifestation of a greater number of potential mechanisms of overyielding in diverse communities, increasing the likelihood of observing a strong diversity effect.},

abstract = {AimsInvasive species continue to be a worldwide threat to ecosystems mainly as a cause for biodiversity loss. Forest ecosystems, for example, are subject to a change in species composition due to the invasion of exotic species. Specifying the attributes that cause the strong competitiveness of several exotic species may improve the ability to understand and effectively manage plant invasions in the future. In this study the following hypotheses were tested: (1) biomass production of below- and aboveground plant components of the exotic tree species is higher than that of the natives, resulting in a higher competitiveness of the exotics; (2) the exclusion of root competition has a positive effect on the biomass production of the inferior native species; and (3) mixtures of native and exotic species yield a higher biomass production than the respective monocultures. MethodsA pot experiment, containing about 2000 tree seedlings, was established. We investigated the biomass productivity and growth reactions of two native (Quercus robur L., Carpinus betulus L.) and two exotic tree species (Prunus serotina Ehrh., Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in different intra- and interspecific, competitive situations with and without the influence of root competition. Important FindingsThe biomass production of both exotic species was significantly higher and led to a strong competitive advantage, resulting in a biomass decrease of the less competitive native species. The high belowground biomass of both exotic species had a negative effect on the biomass production. The competitive pressure of exotic tree seedlings on the native ones was largely driven by root competition. Furthermore, mixtures of native and exotic tree species had a higher productivity than their growth in monocultures would have predicted. Competition was lower for exotic species in mixtures with the less productive native species compared to the competition in monocultures or in mixture with the other highly productive exotic species. Accordingly, both highly competitive exotic species produced less biomass in mixture with each other compared to monocultures. Despite the significantly higher biomass of P. serotina in all mixtures and in monoculture, R. pseudoacacia seemed to be the dominating species. Due to its strong root competition, R. pseudoacacia significantly reduced the biomass production of P. serotina.},

Thus, increasing species richness might help to enhance multifunctionality in managed grasslands if the rela-tionship between species richness and ecosystem functioning is equally valid in high-input grassland systems. We tested the relative effects of low-input to high-input management intensities and low to high plant species rich-ness. Using a combination of mowing frequencies (1, 2 or 4 cuts per season) and fertilisation levels (0, 100 and 200 kg N ha −1 a −1), we studied the productivity of 78 exper-imental grassland communities of increasing plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 species with 1 to 4 functional groups) in two successive years. Our results showed that in both years higher diversity was more effective in increasing productivity than higher man-agement intensity: the 16-species mixtures had a surplus of 449 g m −2 y −1 in 2006 and 492 g m −2 y −1 in 2007 over the monoculture yields whereas the high-input management resulted in only 315 g m −2 y −1 higher productivity in 2006 and 440 g m −2 y −1 in 2007 than the low-input management. In addition, high-diversity low-input grassland communities had similar productivity as low-diversity high-input commu-nities. The slopes of the biodiversity – productivity relation-ships significantly increased with increasing levels of man-agement intensity in both years. We conclude that the biological mechanisms leading to enhanced biomass production in diverse grassland commu-nities are as effective for productivity as a combination of several agricultural measures.

abstract = {Plant selection for extensive green roofs has largely been based on cool, temperate climate research. However, as green roof implementation in hotter and drier climates increases, there is a need to evaluate plant performance under these climatic conditions. Succulents have been shown to be successful in hot and dry green roofs, although survival differs between species and the role of leaf succulence in survival has not been fully explored. For non-succulent plants, habitats with conditions similar to green roofs ('habitat templates') have been used to select plants, although few studies have discussed the performance of these selections under green roof conditions. Therefore, we evaluated establishment of 32 plant species on an unirrigated extensive (125 mm deep) green roof in Melbourne, Australia over a 42 week period (from winter through summer into autumn). Plants were selected on the basis of life-form, succulence, appropriate habitat templates and/or successful use on green roofs internationally. Climatic conditions during the experiment were often extreme, with evaporation regularly exceeding rainfall and a hot and dry summer (mean maximum air temperature 35 °C and 80.6 mm total rainfall), leading to roof temperatures of 65 °C. After 42 weeks, only succulent plants remained alive and only three of the succulent species had 100{\%} survival. Survival was positively related to the degree of leaf succulence (g H2O leaf area cm-1) making this a useful trait for plant selection for unirrigated green roofs in hot, dry climates. The failure of most species, despite being chosen from appropriate habitats, demonstrates the need to evaluate potential plants on green roofs under extreme climatic conditions. Supplementary irrigation may be essential to sustain non-succulent species during extreme weather in hot and dry climates.},

abstract = {A common goal of conservation biological control is to enhance biodiversity and increase abundance and effectiveness of predators and parasitoids. Although many studies report an increase in abundance of natural enemies, it has been difficult to document increases in rates of biological control. To enhance parasitism of the tufted apple bud moth, Platynota idaeusalis (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), alternate food was provided by interplanting peaches bearing extrafloral nectaries into apple (Malus spp.) orchards. Laboratory studies showed that the presence of nectar increased longevity and parasitism rates by Goniozus floridanus (Bethylidae), the dominant parasitoid of tufted apple bud moth in West Virginia. In orchard studies, we found the total number of hymenopteran parasitoids was higher on peach (Prunus spp.) trees than on adjacent apple trees. Abundance of parasitic Hymenoptera also was significantly higher on the side of traps facing away from rather than toward peach trees, indicating attraction to peach trees. However, total parasitism rates of tufted apple bud moth were not affected by the presence of peach extrafloral nectar in any field studies. Insect injury to fruit at harvest showed that fruit from orchards with interplanted peach trees had less injury from San Jose scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock) and stink bugs (Pentatomidae) than fruit from an apple monoculture. Although interplanting with peach trees did not produce the hypothesized result of increased biological control, the experiment did have beneficial results for pest management. These results demonstrate the importance of collecting data on variables beyond the targeted species when evaluating habitat manipulation experiments to fully assess the impact on the ecosystem.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the growth, community structure, and nutrient removal rates between monoculture and mixed wetlands, based on the hypothesis that it depends on the plant species used in the wetlands as to whether monoculture or mixed wetland is superior in plant growth and nutrient removal. Pilot-scale monoculture and mixed constructed wetlands were studied over 4 years. The monoculture wetland had a community height similar to the mixed wetland during the early years but a significantly lower height than the mixed wetland (P{\textless}0.05) during the last year. The mixed wetland also displayed a higher plant density than the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The leaf area index in the monoculture wetland was significantly higher in the first year (P{\textless}0.05) and significantly lower in the later years (P{\textless}0.05) than that in the mixed wetland. The monoculture wetland had a similar vertical distribution of below-ground biomass over 4 years, while the mixed wetland showed a significant change in vertical distribution of below-ground biomass in the last 2 years. The monoculture wetland had a larger (P{\textless}0.05) above-ground biomass and a similar leaf biomass in the first year, and a smaller above-ground biomass (P{\textless}0.05) and a smaller leaf biomass (P{\textless}0.05) than the mixed wetland during the latter 2 years. The amount of standing dead mass was smaller in the mixed wetland than in the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The mixed wetland exhibited a significantly lower NH4-N removal rate in the first year (P{\textless}0.05), and significantly higher NH4-N removal rate in the last year, when compared to the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The study indicated that species competition and stubble growth resulted in significant differences between monoculture and mixed constructed wetlands in plant growth, community structure, and nutrient removal rates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Experimental studies with grassland species found a positive relationship between species richness and community biomass production, however the response of individual species was highly variable. The mechanisms behind these patterns are poorly understood. Here we studied aboveground biomass production and plasticity of growth characteristics of four legumes with similar morphology (Lotus corniculatus, Medicago lupulina, Onobrychis viciifolia, Trifolium hybridum) in experimental grasslands varying in species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and composition. We identified O. viciifolia and T. hybridum as species that reached higher biomass production in mixtures than expected from monoculture yields, while L. corniculatus and M. lupulina mostly had lower yields than expected. Variation of morphological traits across the species-richness gradient was lowest in the highly competitive O. viciifolia, but increased in the smaller species. The tall-growing O. viciifolia achieved higher biomass production by both, a higher number of plant individuals and an increase in mean mass per individual. Mean shoot number per individual remained constant, but individuals produced heavier shoots. The medium-sized T. hybridum also increased the number of plant individuals, but mean mass per individual did not respond to community species richness. The average mass per shoot was increased in mixtures, but the species developed less shoots per individual. Shoot length and stem weight ratio of T. hybridum increased with community species richness. Morphological changes in the less successful L. corniculatus and M. lupulina with a smaller growth stature were similarly directed as those of T. hybridum. The observed morphological changes are known as typical shade-avoidance mechanisms in dense vegetation. Our study shows that stress responses to changes in resource availability may be a mechanism to enforce higher aboveground biomass production of individual species in mixtures, but it depends on species identity whether trait plasticity is large enough to exceed stress-induced growth limitations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that plant species diversity and genetic variation of the host species decrease the severity of plant diseases is supported by studies of agricultural systems, but experimental evidence from more complex systems is scarce. In an experiment with grassland communities of varying species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 60 species) and functional group richness (1, 2, 3, and 4 functional groups), we used different cultivars of Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) to study effects of biodiversity and cultivar identity on the occurrence and severity of foliar fungal diseases caused by Puccinia coronata (crown rust) and P. graminis (stem rust). Cultivar monocultures of perennial ryegrass revealed strong differences in pathogen susceptibility among these cultivars. Disease intensity caused by both rust fungi decreased significantly with growing species richness of species mixtures. The response to the diversity gradient was related to the decreased density and size of the host individuals with increasing species richness. The occurrence of other grass species known to be possible hosts of the pathogens in the experimental mixtures did not promote disease intensity in L. perenne, indicating that there was a high host specificity of pathogen strains. Differences in pathogen susceptibility among perennial ryegrass cultivars persisted independent of diversity treatment, host density and host individual size, but resulted in a cultivar-specific pattern of changes in pathogen infestation across the species-richness gradient. Our study provided evidence that within-species variation in pathogen susceptibility and competitive interactions of the host species with the environment, as caused by species diversity treatments, are key determinants of the occurrence and severity of fungal diseases.},

Location: Krompoort, a farm located on the northern footslopes of the Groot Winterhoek mountains, near Kirkwood, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods: We planted, in degraded, intact and three differently aged post-restoration (P. afra truncheons) sites, nursery-propagated individuals of two woody canopy dominants (Pappea capensis and Searsia longispina), and two inter-canopy shrubs (Lycium ferocissimum and Rhigozum obovatum) in Sep 2008 (spring). The experiment was repeated again in May 2009 (autumn) and a succulent canopy species (P. afra) was added. We assessed restoration success in terms of the survival of planted individuals after 24 mo (spring planting) and 12 mo (autumn planting). The estimated cost of a restoration effort to establish two woody canopy dominant species with the large-scale planting of P. afra was calculated and compared with that of the already established protocol of planting only P. afra truncheons. Results: Survival after spring (24 mo) and autumn (12 mo) plantings of the two woody canopy species was less than 5{\%}, whereas survival of L. ferocissimum was low (19{\%}), R. obovatum good (70{\%}) and P. afra excellent (100{\%}). Contrary to expectations, survival was not related to a gradient of intactness encompassing degraded, restoration and intact treatments that are associated with increasing biomass and soil carbon. The costs of incorporating the four woody canopy species into the restoration programme's protocol were 2.4 times the costs of restoring with P. afra alone. Conclusions: Planting propagules of canopy species other than P. afra is likely to render the programme economically unfeasible, depending on the price of carbon. We conclude that biodiversity goals for the restoration programme are better achieved via spontaneous recruitment of woody canopy and other species, even though this may take more than 40 yr post restoration.},

Because pollinator declines associated with land use change have been reported across the globe, there is great concern that pollinators and the ecosystem services they provide will be negatively affected. This study examines the diversity and abundance of bee pollinators in grasslands in Boulder County, Colorado, USA. Over five years, 5,200 bees were collected in grassland plots with different levels of urbanization. Most of the difference in species composition among three levels of urbanization was due to rare species that may not have been discovered in all plots. Neither the number of species nor their abundance differed significantly among the plot types, although the trend indicated increasing diversity with increasing distance from urbanization. Most notably, measures of urbanization, such as the amount of pavement and development, were not correlated with diversity. The most important factor affecting bee abundance, particularly for ground-nesting bees, was grazing regime. Bee abundance also was positively related to the number of flowering plant species. Other studies of different insects (grasshoppers and butterflies) in these plots showed results similar to ours. In contrast, previous studies on song-birds, raptors, and rodents showed significant differences between urban edge and remote plots in terms of organism abundance and diversity. Together, these results suggest that factors otherthan the degree of urbanization are important in determining insect abundance and diversity.},

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ?functional landscape heterogeneity?. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Keywords},

abstract = {1 Although experimental studies usually reveal that resistance to invasion increases with species diversity, observational studies sometimes show the opposite trend. The higher resistance of diverse plots to invasion may be partly due to the increased probability of a plot containing a species with similar resource requirements to the invader. 2 We conducted a study of the invasibility of monocultures belonging to three different functional groups by seven sown species of legume. By only using experimentally established monocultures, rather than manipulating the abundance of particular functional groups, we removed both species diversity and differences in underlying abiotic conditions as potentially confounding variables. 3 We found that legume monocultures were more resistant than monocultures of grasses or non-leguminous forbs to invasion by sown legumes but not to invasion by other unsown species. The functional group effect remained after controlling for differences in total biomass and the average height of the above-ground biomass. 4 The relative success of legume species and types also varied with monoculture characteristics. The proportional biomass of climbing legumes increased strongly with biomass height in non-leguminous forb monocultures, while it declined with biomass height in grass monocultures. Trifolium pratense was the most successful invader in grass monocultures, while Vicia cracca was the most successful in non-leguminous forb monocultures. 5 Our results suggest that non-random assembly rules operate in grassland communities both between and within functional groups. Legume invaders found it much more difficult to invade legume plots, while grass and non-leguminous forb plots favoured non-climbing and climbing legumes, respectively. If plots mimic monospecific patches, the effect of these assembly rules in diverse communities might depend upon the patch structure of diverse communities. This dependency on patch structure may contribute to differences in results of research from experimental vs. natural communities.},

abstract = {Despite the progress made in explaining trophic interactions through the stoichiometric interplay between consumers and resources, it remains unclear how the number of species in a trophic group influences the effects of elemental imbalances in food webs. Therefore, we conducted a laboratory experiment to test the hypothesis that multispecies producer assemblages alter the nutrient dynamics in a pelagic community. Four algal species were reared in mono-and polycultures under a 2 3 2 factorial combination of light and nutrient supply, thereby contrasting the stoichiometry of trophic interactions involving single vs. multiple producer species. After 9 d, these cultures were fed to the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa, and we monitored biomass, resource use, and C:N:P stoichiometry in both phyto-and zooplankton. According to our expectations, light and N supply resulted in gradients of phytoplankton biomass and nutrient composition (C:N:P). Significant net diversity effects for algal biomass and C:N:P ratios reflected the greater responsiveness of the phytoplankton polyculture to altered resource supply compared to monocultures. These alterations of elemental ratios were common, and were partly triggered by changes in species frequency in the mixtures and partly by diversity-related changes in resource use. Copepod individual biomass increased under high light (HL) and N-reduced ({\`{A}}N) conditions, when food was high in C:N but low in C:P and N:P, whereas copepod growth was obviously P limited, and copepod stoichiometry was not affected by phytoplankton elemental composition. Correspondingly, copepod individual biomass reflected significant net diversity effects: compared to expectations derived from monocultures, copepod individuals feeding on algal polycultures remained smaller than predicted under HL and N-sufficient (þN) conditions but grew larger than predicted under HL, {\`{A}}N and low light þN conditions. In conclusion, multiple producer species altered the stoichiometry of trophic interactions between phyto-and zooplankton, with divergent effects under high and low resource supply.},

abstract = {1. Biotic resistance, the ability of species in a community to limit invasion, is central to our under- standing of how communities at risk of invasion assemble after disturbances, but it has yet to trans- late into guiding principles for the restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities. We combined experimental, functional, and modelling approaches to investigate processes of community assembly contributing to biotic resistance to an introduced lineage of Phragmites australis, a model invasive species in North America. We hypothesized that (i) functional group identity would be a good pre- dictor of biotic resistance to P. australis, while species identity effect would be redundant within functional group (ii) mixtures of species would be more invasion resistant than monocultures. 2. We classified 36 resident wetland plants into four functional groups based on eight functional traits. We conducted two competition experiments based on the additive competition design with P. australis and monocultures or mixtures of wetland plants. As an indicator of biotic resistance, we calculated a relative competition index (RCIavg) based on the average performance of P. australis in competition treatment compared with control. To explain diversity effect further, we partitioned it into selection effect and complementarity effect and tested several diversity–interaction models. 3. In monoculture treatments, RCIavg of wetland plants was significantly different among functional groups, but not within each functional group. We found the highest RCIavg for fast-growing annuals, suggesting priority effect. 4. RCIavg of wetland plants was significantly greater in mixture than in monoculture mainly due to complementarity–diversity effect among functional groups. In diversity–interaction models, species interaction patterns in mixtures were described best by interactions between functional groups when fitted to RCIavg or biomass, implying niche partitioning. 5. Synthesis. Functional group identity and diversity of resident plant communities are good indicators of biotic resistance to invasion by introduced Phragmites australis, suggesting niche pre- emption (priority effect) and niche partitioning (diversity effect) as underlying mechanisms. Guiding principles to understand and/or manage biological invasion could emerge from advances in commu- nity theory and the use of a functional framework. Targeting widely distributed invasive plants in different contexts and scaling up to field situations will facilitate generalization.},

abstract = {Experimental evidence that plant species diversity has positive effects on biomass production appears to conflict with correlations of species diversity and standing biomass in natural communities. This may be due to the confounding effects of a third variable, resource availability, which has strong control over both diversity and productivity in natural systems and may conceal any positive effects of diversity on productivity. To test this hypothesis, I independently manipulated resource availability (soil fertility) and sown species diversity in a field experiment and measured their individual and interactive effects on productivity. Although fertility was a far stronger predictor of productivity than diversity, the effect of diversity on productivity significantly increased with fertility. Relative yield analyses indicated that plant mixtures of high fertility treatments significantly "overyielded," or were more productive than expected based on monoculture yields of component species. In contrast, plant mixtures of low fertility treatments had significantly lower-than-expected yields. The effect of diversity on productivity was also driven by sampling effects, where more species-rich mixtures were more likely to include particularly productive species. Unexpectedly, the strength of sampling effects was largely insensitive to fertility, although the particular species most responsible for sampling effects did change with fertility. These results suggest that positive effects of species diversity on ecosystem productivity in natural systems are likely to be masked by variation in environmental factors among habitats.},

abstract = {1.Belowground resource partitioning is often proposed as the underlying mechanism for the positive relationship between plant species richness and productivity. For example, if species have different root distributions, a mixture of plant species may be able to use the available resources more completely than the individual species in a monoculture. However, there is little experimental evidence for differentiation in vertical root distributions among species and its contribution to biodiversity effects. 2.We determined species-specific root standing biomass over depth using molecular techniques (real time-qPCR) in a large grassland biodiversity experiment (1-8 plant species mixtures), in two years. Species-specific root biomass data were used to disentangle the effects of positive interactions between species (complementarity effects) and effects due to dominance of productive species (selection effects) on root biomass in mixtures. In a next step, these biodiversity effects were linked to the diversity of rooting depths and the averaged rooting depth of the community. 3.Root biomass increased with species richness. This was mainly due to positive interactions (the complementarity effect), which increased with species richness belowground. In contrast, the selection effect decreased with species richness. Although there was considerable variation in vertical root distribution between species in monocultures, the diversity of rooting strategies did not explain the complementarity effect. Rather, the abundance of deep-rooting species in mixtures (i.e. high community weighted mean) was significantly related to the complementarity effect. Comparing the ‘predicted' root distribution (based on monocultures) to the actual distribution in mixtures, we found that mixtures rooted deeper than expected, but this did not better explain the complementarity effect. 4.Synthesis: This study demonstrates that vertical root distributions of species provide only subtle evidence for resource partitioning. We found no evidence that functional diversity in vertical rooting patterns was important for the complementarity effect, in contrast to our expectation that the enhancement of productivity was due to resource partitioning. Alternatively, we found significant but weak relationships between the complementarity effect and deep-rooting communities, based on the community weighted mean root distribution. This suggests that factors other than belowground resource partitioning alone may drive the biodiversity-productivity relationship. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Root diame- ter of the finest absorptive roots may be one plant trait that has wide significance. Do species with relatively thick absorptive roots forage in nutrient-rich patches differently from species with relatively fine absorptive roots? ・We measured traits related to nutrient foraging (root morphology and architecture, root proliferation, and mycorrhizal colonization) across six coexisting arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) temperate tree species and without nutrient addition. ・Root traits such as root diameter and specific root length were highly correlated with root branching intensity, with thin-root species having higher branching intensity than thick-root species. In both fertilized and unfertilized soil, species with thin absorptive roots and high branching intensity showed much greater root length and mass proliferation but lower mycor- rhizal colonization than species with thick absorptive roots. Across all species, fertilization led to increased root proliferation and reduced mycorrhizal colonization. ・These results suggest that thin-root species forage more by root proliferation, whereas thick-root species forage more by mycorrhizal fungi. In mineral nutrient-rich patches, AM trees seem to forage more by proliferating roots than by mycorrhizal fungi.},

This study investigates their value for UK bat species within the context of the built environment. Green roofs were categorised as ‘sedum' or ‘biodiverse' according to their dominant vegetation type. Bat activity was monitored over 13 biodiverse, nine sedum and 17 conventional un-vegetated roofs located within the Greater London area for seven nights using Anabat SD1 detectors. Influence of roof type and environmental variables on bat activity were evaluated using generalised linear models. Pipistrellus pipistrellus were most frequently recorded followed by Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Nyctalus/Eptesicus and Pipistrellus nathusii. The mean number of call sequences per night was 5.2. Feeding events accounted for 16{\%} (217) of call sequences. Bat activity was significantly higher over biodiverse roofs compared to conventional roofs. A greater extent of suitable habitat within the surrounding area had a positive influence on bat activity but numbers of call sequences and feeding events were significantly higher over biodiverse roofs compared to conventional roofs when suitable habitat within a 100 metre radius of the roof was below 33{\%} cover. Other factors affecting bat activity included roof height (negative influence with increased height) and the month of survey. No significant differences were found between sedum and conventional roofs. The findings suggest that biodiverse roofs offer enhanced habitat for bats within the context of urbanised environments. Further studies are needed to predict more accurately their value as a bat conservation measure.},

abstract = {The ability to respond in a specific manner to different light conditions imposed by different species of grass is a major factor contributing to white clover persistence in pastures. Gaps in a pasture provide light with a higher red:far-red ratio (R:FR) and higher photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) than the light filtered through neighbours. White clover (Trifolium repens L.) was grown under different light conditions in ways that tried to simulate as closely as possible some of the light conditions experienced in a natural field situation, being partially shaded and receiving light reflected from neighbouring grasses. The objective was to determine specifically if the mere presence of neighbouring grasses could influence the growth and morphology of white clover individuals without physically contacting them, and thereby send a signal of impending competition. In the first experiment, white clover was subjected to shading cast from three different grass species. There were differences in both the quantity and quality of light received under the various grass canopies. The canopies reduced overall growth and branching of clones, while increasing the length of and biomass allocation to petioles. Lolium perenne L. canopy shade had different effects compared to Holcus lanatus L. or Dactylis glomerata L., but between the latter two species, no differences were detected. In the second experiment, light reflected from grass neighbours was provided simultaneously with direct light. There was a strong increase in FR and a resulting decrease in the R:FR due to neighbouring D. glomerata, but few consistent effects on white clover growth and morphology; there was evidence of phototropic movement by the leaves. We show that plants must experience partial shading, and not just reflected light, in order to alter their morphology in response to the presence of different species of grass neighbours.},

abstract = {1 If different factors inhibiting plant growth, e.g. low rainfall or low soil nutrients, were to select for species that have similar constellations of traits, then the unfavourable factors might usefully be grouped together as 'stress'. 2 We offer a method for assessing this issue. A species mixture at a site is described by a point on a plane with two traits as axes. Change along an environmental gradient is then represented as a trajectory across the trait-plane. Trajectories along different environmental gradients are compared. 3 We measured leaf width, specific leaf area (SLA) and mature canopy height for the 386 perennial species found at 46 sites spread along rainfall and soil total phosphorus gradients in south-eastern Australia. Each trait was lognormally distributed across species within sites, hence the mean of log10(trait) satisfactorily described the species mixture at each site. 4 Combinations of assemblage-mean leaf width with SLA followed similar trajectories as rainfall and soil total P decreased. For these traits in this setting, the method indicated that low rainfall and low soil P favour similar trait-combinations. 5 Mature plant height also decreased along both rainfall and soil P gradients, and thus was positively correlated with leaf width and SLA at the level of assemblage means. The rainfall trajectories involving height behaved differently from the soil P trajectories, especially at rainfalls below c. 400 mm year22121, where assemblage-mean height declined much further than at low soil P. 6 Across all species, traits were only very loosely correlated (r2 from 0.04 to 0.17). For leaf width and SLA, evolutionary divergences were positively correlated, both before and after cross-correlation with divergence in rainfall and soil P was removed. This latter measures evolutionary divergence correlation within habitat. For height the picture was more complicated. Considering these within-habitat divergence correlations, species that were taller at maturity tended to have lower SLA and leaf width. This pattern is the reverse of the broad geographical correlation of assemblage means, showing that the patterns across assemblages result from species being selectively sifted from the regional flora into sites, not from evolutionary or cross-species correlations. 7 The trait-combination trajectory approach showed some commonalities between low soil nutrient and low rainfall habitats with regard to traits favoured in species occurring there, but also some differences. The approach has potential for clarifying which environmental factors can usefully be grouped together as 'stress', and which trait combinations can usefully be regarded as part of a syndrome favoured by stress.},

abstract = {The replacement of native forests by exotic tree monocultures, such as those of Eucalyptus, decreases the quality of leaf litter inputs to streams and often reduces riparian cover, which can elevate water temperature. The combined effects of these stressors on the survival and performance of detritivores may be important, as detritivore species loss leads to reduced litter breakdown, a key ecosystem process. Potential loss of cased caddisfly larvae is of particular concern because they are the predominant detritivores in many streams, they are sensitive to warming, and they expend energy on building and carrying their cases, which may be an added burden under times of stress. In a microcosm experiment, we tested whether (i) poor-quality Eucalyptus globulus litter impaired case construction by larvae of Sericostoma pyrenaicum (due to preferential allocation of the scarcer available energy to larval fitness) compared to high-quality Alnus glutinosa litter; (ii) whether this effect was enhanced by higher temperatures (15 vs. 10°C) resulting in faster metabolism and greater energy expenditure; but (iii) reduced in the presence of chemical cues from a predatory fish (due to greater investment in more protective cases). We found that Eucalyptus had lethal and sublethal effects on larval caddisflies, increasing mortality, reducing growth, and impairing case construction, compared to larvae fed Alnus. Temperature did not reinforce the effects of exotic litter on case construction, but predator chemical cues triggered the construction of more protective cases (i.e., longer and better cemented) despite the lower resource quality, providing evidence for environmentally mediated resource-allocation tradeoffs.},

abstract = {Despite being conspicuous and influential features of the biosphere, urban ecosystems have been neglected in ecological research. Arthropods are abundant in urban settings, but little is known about how these animals respond to urbanization. We systematically monitored the structure of ground arthropod communities for 12 months at 16 sites representing the four most abundant forms of urban land use (residential, industrial, agricultural, and desert remnant) in a rapidly growing metropolitan area (Phoenix, AZ). Although taxonomic richness was comparable among land-use types, community composition differed, with certain taxa being uniquely associated with each form of land use. Three taxa (springtails, ants, and mites) were extremely widespread and abundant, accounting for over 92{\%} of captures; when these three taxa were excluded from analysis, however, differences were revealed in arthropod community composition with urban land use. Trophic dynamics also varied with land use: predators, herbivores, and detritivores were most abundant in agricultural sites, while onmivores were equally abundant in all forms of land use. These community-level differences resulted from taxon-specific responses to habitat structure, which varied with land use. Because arthropod community structure is affected by habitat structure and land use, and because arthropods play key roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, pollination, and soil aeration, the spatial heterogeneity of urban ecosystems therefore may affect ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Species' extinctions have spurred debate on whether interactions among few or among many species cause a positive diversity–productivity relationship in experimentally assembled grasslands. We addressed this question by quantifying the productivity of 14 species across an experimental diversity gradient in Minnesota. We found that interspecific interactions leading to coexistence and competitive displacement both determine which species overyield; i.e. are more productive at high diversity. Overyielding species were either superior N competitors (C4 grasses) or N fixers (legumes). Surprisingly, these species were not most productive in monoculture, thus, the ‘selection' of productive species in diverse plots did not cause the positive diversity–productivity relationship. Both positive (with legumes) and negative interspecific interactions (with C4 grasses) determined whether individual species overyielded. Foliar pathogens did not cause overyielding, although other natural enemies may be responsible. Overyielding species are not displacing underyielding species over time, implying that other diversity-promoting interactions also operate in this experiment.},

abstract = {Many invasive plant species strongly alter ecosystem processes by producing leaf litter that decomposes faster and releases N more quickly than that of native species. However, while most studies of invasive species litter impacts have only considered the decomposition of species in monoculture, forest litter layers typically contain litter from many species. Many litter mixtures decompose in a non-additive manner, in which the mixture decomposes more quickly (synergistic eff ect) or more slowly (antagonistic eff ect) than would be expected based on decomposition of the component species ' litters in isolation. We investigated the potential for non-additive eff ects of invasive species ' litter by conducting a one-year litter bag experiment in which we mixed the litters of four native tree species with each of four invasive species. Litter mixtures frequently lost mass at non-additive rates, although not at every loading ratio, and the presence, sign, and strength of eff ects depended on species composition. Non-additive eff ects on N loss occurred in more litter combinations, and were almost always antagonistic at 90 days and synergistic at 365 days. Invasive species litter with lower C:N led to more strongly synergistic N loss with time. During the growing season, non-additive patterns of N loss almost always resulted in increased N release – up to six times greater than would be expected based on single-species decomposition. Consequently, we suggest that invasive species may further synchronize N release from the litter layer with plant N demand, enhancing any positive litter feedback to invasion. Th ese results highlight the need to consider non-additive eff ects of litter mixing in invaded forest communities, and suggest that estimates of invasive species ' impacts on ecosystem processes would be improved by considering these effects.},

abstract = {While the ecological consequences of plant diversity have received much attention, the mechanisms by which intraspecific diversity affects associa-ted communities remains understudied. We report on a field experiment documenting the effects of patch diversity in the plant Baccharis salicifolia (genotypic monocultures versus polycultures of four genotypes), ants (pres-ence versus absence) and their interaction on ant-tended aphids, ants and parasitic wasps, and the mechanistic pathways by which diversity influences their multi-trophic interactions. Five months after planting, polycultures (versus monocultures) had increased abundances of aphids (threefold), ants (3.2-fold) and parasitoids (1.7-fold) owing to non-additive effects of genetic diversity. The effect on aphids was direct, as plant genetic diversity did not mediate ant–aphid, parasitoid–aphid or ant–parasitoid interactions. This increase in aphid abundance occurred even though plant growth (and thus aphid resources) was not higher in polycultures. The increase in ants and para-sitoids was an indirect effect, due entirely to higher aphid abundance. Ants reduced parasitoid abundance by 60 per cent, but did not affect aphid abun-dance or plant growth, and these top-down effects were equivalent between monocultures and polycultures. In summary, intraspecific plant diversity did not increase primary productivity, but nevertheless had strong effects across multiple trophic levels, and effects on both herbivore mutualists and enemies could be predicted entirely as an extension of plant–herbivore interactions.},

In this review, we present the current knowledge of drought resistance of tropical mixed species plantations and summarize preliminary evidence from a tree biodiversity experiment in Panama. Converting mono-specific stands into mixed ones may improve stand stability and might reduce increasing abiotic and biotic disturbances due to climate change. However, little is known about the extent to which tropical tree species or tropical tree communities can resist increasing disturbances in the short term, e.g., water limitations due to increasing dry season intensity or length, or about their resilience after such disturbances and their capacity to adapt to changing conditions in the long term. Studies relating drought resistance and resilience to community diversity are missing. Further, we highlight the urgent need for a multifactorial manipulative throughfall reduction experiment in tropical environments. The outcome of such studies would greatly assist the forestry sector in tropical regions to maintain highly productive and ecologically sound forest plantations in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Ecosystems worldwide are increasingly impacted by multiple drivers of environmental change, including climate warming and loss of biodiversity. We show, using a long-term factorial experiment, that plant diversity loss alters the effects of warming on productivity. Aboveground primary productivity was increased by both high plant diversity and warming, and, in concert, warming (≈1.5°C average above and belowground warming over the growing season) and diversity caused a greater than additive increase in aboveground productivity. The aboveground biodiversity effects increased over time, particularly at higher levels of diversity, perhaps because of warming-induced increases in legume and C4 bunch grass abundances, and facilitative feedbacks of these species on productivity. Moreover, higher plant diversity was associated with the amelioration of warming-induced environmental conditions. This led to cooler temperatures, increased vapor pressure deficit, and increased surface soil moisture in higher diversity communities. Root biomass (0-30 cm) was likewise consistently greater at higher plant diversity, and was greater with warming in monocultures and at intermediate diversity, but at high diversity warming had no detectable effect. This may be because warming increased the abundance of legumes, which have lower root:shoot ratios than the other types of plants. In addition, legumes increase soil nitrogen supply, which could make N less limiting to other species and potentially decrease their investment in roots. The negative warming x diversity interaction on root mass led to an overall negative interactive effect of these two global change factors on the sum of above and belowground biomass, and thus likely on total plant carbon stores. In total, plant diversity increased the effect of warming on aboveground net productivity and moderated the effect on root mass. These divergent effects suggest that warming and changes in plant diversity are likely to have both interactive and divergent impacts on various aspects of ecosystem functioning.

abstract = {In this study, replacement of dominant populations (Phragmites australis and Phalaris arundinacea) in the plant community succession process in the Zhenjiang Waterfront Wetland was approached from three aspects: growth, photosynthesis, and specific competitive characteristics. The productivity of Phragmites, based on intrinsic rate of increase and environmental carrying capacity of the several chosen growth indices (plant length, sheath height, and biomass), was significantly higher than that of Phalaris. Phragmites had a higher photosynthetic rate than Phalaris. However, Phalaris had a markedly lower light compensation point, which suggested that it was capable of better utilization of weak light. This possibly might account for its survival beneath Phragmites. At three different coverage gradients, the relative yield total was greater than 1, indicating a certain degree of complementary resource utilization via niche separation between both species. Significant differences in the competition ratio of both species indicated a superiority of Phragmites over Phalaris in terms of competitive capability. Thus, the Phragmites population tended to exclude the Phalaris population and became the mono-dominant population in the community succession process. For Phalaris, traits such as its better utilization of weak light, its complementary resource utilization, and a partial separation of growth period compared to Phragmites prevented complete replacement of its population to some degree. In this particular study area in the Zhenjiang Waterfront Wetland, the hydrological conditions of the river beach determined by its elevation possibly acted as the dominant regulator of the plant succession process. -{\textregistered} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V},

Effects of plant species richness on nutrient retention and enzyme activities were assessed using soil chemical and zymological methods, respectively. Retention of NH4-N and NO3-N in the wetland substrate increased with increasing species richness, while phosphorus retention significantly decreased under the richness level of 16 species per plot. Activities of enzymes such as dehydrogenase, $\beta$-glucosidase, invertase, phenol oxidase, L-arsparaginase, protease and nitrate reductase, while they were affected by plant species richness, were strongly depended on the presence or absence of plants in CW substrate, while activities of enzymes such as CM-cellulase, urease and acid phosphatase were strongly depended on plant species richness.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Proliferation of macroalgal blooms is regulated by grazing pressure and nutrient availability, which may be mediated directly by benthic macroinvertebrates or indirectly through feedback mechanisms. Using invertebrates common to a shallow estuary in Cape Cod, Massachusetts (USA), we determined effects of faunal diversity on benthic microalgae, net ecosystem metabolism, sediment nutrient fluxes, and macroalgal biomass and productivity. Laboratory microcosms contained sediments with single- and mixed-species invertebrate assemblages, in the presence of (1) no macroalgae, (2) a macroalgal monoculture, and (3) a realistic macroalgal polyculture. The deposit-feeding gastropod Ilyanassa obsoleta suppressed benthic microalgae, enhanced nitrate efflux from sediments, and maintained macroalgal standing stocks. Conversely, the burrowing, omnivorous polychaete Alitta (formerly Nereis) virens stimulated benthic microalgal growth, inhibited efflux of ammonium, and drastically reduced macroalgal biomass via grazing and translocation of thalli below the sediment surface. In the polyculture experiment, A. virens sequentially removed Gracilaria sp. (Rhodophyta), Ulva sp. (Chlorophyta), and finally Fucus vesiculosus (Phaeophyta). The bivalve Mya arenaria exhibited limited effects on benthic dynamics. In mixed-fauna assemblages, biomass and productivity of benthic microalgae and macroalgae were consistently lower than predicted, revealing non-additive effects of biodiversity. Communities dominated by I. obsoleta or other surficial grazers could indirectly promote macroalgal blooms via sustained release of sediment-derived nutrients and reduction of benthic microalgae. In contrast, omnivorous burrowers such as A. virens may buffer symptoms of eutrophication through inhibition of ammonium supply and direct grazing of bloom-forming macroalgae. Overall, our results highlight species-specific effects on key ecosystem functions, and demonstrate important feedbacks between top-down and bottom-up controls in shallow estuaries.},

abstract = {Cropping systems that rely on renewable energy and resources and are based on ecological principles could be more stable and productive into the future than current monoculture systems with serious unintended environmental consequences such as soil erosion and water pollution. In nonagricultural systems, communities with higher species diversity have higher productivity and provide other ecosystem services. However, communities of well-adapted crop species selected for biomass production may respond differently to increasing diversity. Diversity effects may be due to complementarity among species (complementary resource use and facilitative interactions) or positive selection effects (e.g., species with higher productivity dominate the mixture), and these effects may change over time or across environments. Our goal was to identify the ecological mechanisms causing diversity effects in a biodiversity experiment using agriculturally relevant species, and evaluate the implications for the design of sustainable cropping systems. We seeded seven perennial forage species in a replicated field experiment at two locations in Iowa, USA, and evaluated biomass productivity of monocultures and two- to six-species mixtures over 3 years after the establishment year under management systems of contrasting intensity: one or three harvests per year. Productivity increased with seeded species richness in all environments, and the positive relationship did not change over time. Polyculture overyielding was due to complementarity among species in the community rather than to selection effects of individual species. Complementarity increased as a log-linear function of species richness in all environments, and this trend was consistent across years. Legume–grass facilitation may explain much of this complementarity effect. Although individual species with high biomass production had a major effect on productivity of mixtures, the species producing the highest biomass in monoculture changed over the years in most environments. Furthermore, transgressive overyielding was observed and was more prevalent in later years, in some environments. We conclude that choosing a single well-adapted species for maximizing productivity may not be the best alternative over the long term and that high levels of species diversity should be included in the design of productive and ecologically sound agricultural systems.},

In this paper, we examined N2O flux and related parameters in response of plant species richness in microcosms simulating CWs. Results showed that, N2O emissions increased with plant species richness (P{\textless}0.05), ranged from 902 to 1848$\mu$gN2Om-2d-1; nitrogen removal, abundance of nitrite- and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrification rate, as well as nitrate reductase activities, also increased with species richness (P{\textless}0.05); N2O emission increasing was more sensitive to plant species richness than nitrogen removal rate, however, there was no response in denitrification rates and denitrifier abundance to species richness (P{\textgreater}0.05). Manipulation of plant species richness may provide an opportunity to increase the nitrogen removal efficiency in CWs, with an expense of simultaneously raising greenhouse gas emission. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {The ontogenetic niche concept predicts that resource use depends on an organism's developmental stage. This concept has been investigated primarily in animals that show differing resource use strategies as juveniles and as adults, such as amphibians. We studied resource use and performance in the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus (Orthoptera, Acrididae) provided with food plant mixtures of either one, three or eight plant species throughout their development. C. parallelus survival and fecundity was highest in the food plant mixture with eight plant species and lowest in the treatments where only one single plant species was offered as food. C. parallelus' consumption throughout its ontogeny depended on sex, and feeding on different plant species was dependent on a grasshopper's developmental stage. To depict grasshopper foraging in food plant mixtures compared to foraging on single plant species, we introduce the term "relative forage total" (RFT) based on an approach used in biodiversity research by Loreau and Hector (Nature 413:548-274, 2001). RFT of grasshoppers in food plant mixtures was always higher than what would have been expected from foraging in monocultures. The increase in food consumption was due to an overall increase in feeding on plant species in mixtures compared to consumption of the same species offered as a single diet. Thus we argue that grasshopper foraging exhibits complementarity effects. Our results reinforce the necessity to consider development-related changes in insect herbivore feeding. Thorough information on the feeding ontogeny of insect herbivores could not only elucidate their nutritional ecology but also help to shed light on their functional role in plant communities.},

abstract = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67{\%} to 96{\%} but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78{\%} in temperate-zone communities to 94{\%} in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5{\%} of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems},

abstract = {This study aimed to measure the effect of plant diversity on N uptake in grasslands and to assess the mechanisms contributing to diversity effects. Annual N uptake into above- and belowground organs and soil nitrate pools were measured in the Jena experiment on a floodplain soil with mixtures of 2-16 species and 1-4 functional groups, and monocultures. In mixtures, the deviation of measured data from data expected from monoculture performance was calculated to assess the contribution of complementarity/facilitation and selection. N uptake varied from {\textless} 1 to 45 g N m(-2) yr(-1), and was higher in grasslands with than without legumes. On average, N uptake was higher in mixtures (21 +/- 1 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) than monocultures (13 +/- 1 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), and increased with species richness in mixtures. However, compared to N uptake expected from biomass proportions of species in mixtures, N uptake of mixtures was only slightly higher and a significant surplus N uptake was confined to mixtures containing legumes and non-legumes. In our study, high N uptake of species rich mixtures was mainly due to dominance of productive species and facilitation by legumes whereas complementarity among non-legumes was of minor relevance.},

abstract = {In this study, we used data from temperate grassland plant communities in Alberta, Canada to test two longstanding hypotheses in ecology: 1) that there has been correlated evolution of the leaves and roots of plants due to selection for an integrated whole-plant resource uptake strategy, and 2) that trait diversity in ecological communities is generated by adaptations to the conditions in different habitats. We tested the first hypothesis using phylogenetic comparative methods to test for evidence of correlated evolution of suites of leaf and root functional traits in these grasslands. There were consistent evolutionary correlations among traits related to plant resource uptake strategies within leaf tissues, and within root tissues. In contrast, there were inconsistent correlations between the traits of leaves and the traits of roots, suggesting different evolutionary pressures on the above and belowground components of plant morphology. To test the second hypothesis, we evaluated the relative importance of two components of trait diversity: within-community variation (species trait values relative to co-occurring species; $\alpha$ traits) and among-community variation (the average trait value in communities where species occur; $\beta$ traits). Trait diversity was mostly explained by variation among co-occurring species, not among-communities. Additionally, there was a phylogenetic signal in the within-community trait values of species relative to co-occurring taxa, but not in their habitat associations or among-community trait variation. These results suggest that sorting of pre-existing trait variation into local communities can explain the leaf and root trait diversity in these grasslands.},
annote = {- two hypotheses
(1) correlated evolution of leaves and roots of plants (resource uptake strategy)
(2) trait diversity in ecological communities by adaptations to the conditions in different habitats
- haven't tested for phylogenetic relatedness in leaf-root trait correlations; species are not independent units
- what explains within-community and among-community trait variation?
(1) alpha trait - species trait values relative to co-occuring species
(2) beta trait - average trait value in communities where species occur
(3) 'a first B throughout' hypothesi: alpha niche comes before beta niche (sorted by environment) --{\textgreater} phylogenetic signal within-communities
(4) hierarcial diversification hypothesis: colonization of different habitats precedes alpha niche --{\textgreater} phylogenetic signal in traits of taxa living in different habitats, but not traits of co-occurring taxa

Findings:
- limited support for correlated evolution of leaf and root traits of plants
- fundamentally different selective pressures on trait evolution above and belowground
- alpha traits and niches are more phylogenetically conserved than beta traits},

abstract = {We hypothesised that plant species composition and richness would affect soil chemical and microbial community properties, and that these in turn would affect soil microbial resistance and resilience to an experimentally imposed drying disturbance. We performed a container experiment that manipulated the composition and species richness of common pasture plant species (Trifolium repens, Lolium perenne, and Plantago lanceolata) by growing them in monoculture, and in all the possible two and three-way combinations, along with an unplanted control soil. Experimental units were harvested at four different times over a 16-month period to determine the effect of plant community development and seasonal changes in temperature and moisture on belowground properties. Results showed that plant species composition influenced soil chemistry, soil microbial community properties and soil microbial resistance and resilience. Soil from planted treatments generally showed reduced soil microbial resistance to drying compared to unplanted control soils. Soils from under T. repens showed a higher resistance and resilience than the soils from under P. lanceolata, and a higher resistance than soils from under L. perenne. We suggest that differences across soils in either resource limitation or soil microbial community structure may be responsible for these results. Plant species richness rarely affected soil microbial community properties or soil microbial resistance and resilience, despite having some significant effects on plant community biomass and soil nitrogen contents in some harvests. The effect that treatments had for most variables differed between harvests, suggesting that results can be altered by the stage of plant community development or by extrinsic environmental factors that varied with harvest timing. These results in combination show that soil microbial resistance and resilience was affected by plant community composition, and the time of measurement, but was largely unrelated to plant species richness.},

I focused on variation within and among genotypes in plant stem height, a trait that varies substantially across environmental gradients and can be an important predictor of plant competition intensity. 3.Trait and genotypic diversity interactively affected multiple metrics of plant performance. Both stem density and spatial spread increased with genotypic diversity in the low trait diversity combinations, yet there were negligible to weak negative effects in the high trait diversity treatments. S. alterniflora percent cover also varied with genotypic and trait diversity, but not in a clear linear pattern. 4.There were no effects of trait or genotypic diversity on associated macrofauna above-ground, yet they interactively affected below-ground measures. Infaunal abundance and sediment oxygen availability mirrored the idiosyncratic response of plant percent cover. 5.Despite the interactive effects of genotypic and trait diversity, high trait diversity consistently increased plant performance in genotypic monoculture. 6.Synthesis: The effects of intraspecific plant trait diversity on a range of plant and community responses in this study reinforce the premise that functional differences underlie ecological effects of genetic diversity and suggest that readily measured trait variance may serve as a valuable predictor of plant performance.

abstract = {Constructed ecosystems such as green roofs often contain monocultures or low-diversity plant communities, but adding more plant species to these systems can increase ecosystem service provisioning. Mixture advantage, when species-rich treatments outperform the best monocultures, is desirable in constructed ecosystems due to the cost of increasing diversity. However, there have not been any studies in constructed ecosystems that have quantitatively compared mixtures with the best monocultures for multifunctionality, and there have been few studies that have examined how provision of ecosystem services changes over time as plant communities develop. In a green roof system, I predicted (i) that the mixture advantage would be stronger for ecosystem multifunctionality than for single ecosystem functions and (ii) that ecosystem service provisioning and complementarity in above-ground biomass would increase over time. Fifteen monocultures of plant species from five life-form groups (succulents, tall forbs, dwarf shrubs, creeping forbs, grasses) were compared with three-species mixtures of the same life-form and mixtures of species from three and five different life-forms in a modular green roof system. Indicators of ecosystem services including above-ground production, thermal regulation, stormwater retention, nutrient uptake and carbon sequestration and two indices of ecosystem multifunctionality were compared. Canopy density increased over time while substrate temperature decreased, suggesting higher provisioning of valuable ecosystem services. For single services, the positive relationship between planted species richness and ecosystem service grew stronger over time, but was consistently strong over time for multifunctionality. Quantile regression indicated a weak mixture advantage for several services including both multifunctionality indices. While the effects were small, different species optimized different functions, thus multifunctioning is enhanced in more diverse mixtures by combining species that maximize different functions. Tripartite partitioning of canopy density showed that overyielding and trait-independent complementarity fluctuated between years in response to shifts in species abundances, but dominance and trait-dependent complementarity increased over time. Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first evidence in a constructed ecosystem that mixtures can outperform the best monocultures for multiple ecosystem services. Mixtures of plant life-forms can improve green roof performance. The biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships observed in natural ecosystems can also occur in novel and highly simplified engineered ecosystems.

abstract = {Five tropical treatment wetlands dominated by floating aquatic plants and constructed to deal with a variety of wastewaters were compared for their effectiveness in treating organic matter and nutrients in the Parismina River Basin in eastern Costa Rica. Wastewaters were from a dairy farm, a dairy processing plant, a banana paper plant, and a landfill. Four of the five wetland systems were effective in reducing nutrient levels of effluents before water was discharged into rivers. Ammonia levels in water entering most wetlands were considerably higher than ambient (i.e., riverine) levels; concentrations were reduced by as much as 92{\%} in the wetlands and retained at a maximum rate of 166 g N m-2year-1. Nitrate nitrogen removal was variable, but occurred in low concentrations in the inflows (less than 1 mg N L-1). Phosphate phosphorus was present in high levels but was effectively reduced through the wetlands (92 and 45{\%} reductions through dairy farm wetlands, 83{\%} reduction through banana paper wetlands, and 80{\%} reduction through dairy processing wetlands). Retention of phosphate phosphorus ranged from 0.1 to 10.7 g P m-2year-1in the treatment wetlands. Dissolved oxygen in the wetland outflows were ≤2 mg L-1in three of the sampled wetlands, most likely a result of the abundant free-floating macrophytes that sheltered the water from diffusion and shaded aquatic productivity. The efficacy of these created wetlands to treat effluents from different sources varied, and modified wetland designs or active management may be necessary to improve water quality even further.

Additionally, divergence in a 658 bp segment of the mitochondrial COI gene (the “DNA barcode” region) was used to clarify the taxonomic status of several Megachile species in North America. Based on morphological differences and over 6{\%} sequence divergence in COI, M. (Litomegachile) onobrychidis Cockerell, previously considered a subspecies of M. (Litomegachile) brevis Say, is recognized here as a valid species. Similarly, M. (Litomegachile) pseudobrevis Mitchell, found in the southeastern United States, is also considered a distinct species and removed from synonymy with M. brevis. Megachile (Eutricharaea) apicalis Spinola and M. (Megachiloides) casadae Cockerell and M. (Megachiloides) umatillensis (Mitchell) are recorded from Canada for the first time; M.

abstract = {Context – During the last two decades, functional biodiversity research has provided strong support for the hypothesis that more biodiverse ecosystems have the potential to deliver more and better services. However, most empirical support for this hypothesis comes from simple structured communities that are relatively easy to manipulate. The impact of forest biodiversity on forest ecosystem functioning has been far less studied. Experiment design – In this paper, we present the recently established, large-scale FORBIO experiment (FORest BIOdiversity and Ecosystem Functioning), specifically designed to test the effects of tree species diversity on forest ecosystem functioning. FORBIO's design matches with that of the few other tree diversity experiments worldwide, but at the same time, the FORBIO experiment is unique as it consists of a similar experimental set-up at three sites in Belgium (Zedelgem, Hechtel-Eksel and Gedinne) with contrasting edaphic and climatological characteristics. This design will help to provide answers to one of the most interesting unresolved questions in functional biodiversity research, notably whether the effects of complementarity on ecosystem functioning decrease in less stressful and more productive environments. At each site, FORBIO consists of 41 to 44 plots (127 plots in total) planted with monocultures and mixtures up to four species, selected from a pool of five site-adapted, functionally different tree species. When allocating the treatments to the plots, we maximally avoided any possible covariation between environmental factors. Monitoring of ecosystem functioning already started at the Zedelgem and Gedinne sites and will start soon in Hechtel-Eksel. Multiple processes are being measured and as the trees grow older, we plan to add even more processes. Expected results – Not only basic science, but also forest management will benefit from the results coming from the FORBIO experiment, as FORBIO is, for instance, also a test case for uncommon, not well-known tree species mixtures. To conclude, FORBIO is an important ecosystem experiment that has the potential to deliver badly needed insights into the multiple relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, which will be valuable for both science and practice.},

The habitat components determining the structure of bee commu-nities are well known when considering foraging resources; however, there is little data with respect to the role of nesting resources. 2. As a model system this study uses 21 diverse bee communities in a Mediterra-nean landscape comprising a variety of habitats regenerating after fire. The find-ings clearly demonstrate that a variety of nesting substrates and nest building materials have key roles in organising the composition of bee communities. 3. The availability of bare ground and potential nesting cavities were the two primary factors influencing the structure of the entire bee community, the com-position of guilds, and also the relative abundance of the dominant species. Other nesting resources shown to be important include availability of steep and sloping ground, abundance of plant species providing pithy stems, and the occurrence of pre-existing burrows. 4. Nesting resource availability and guild structure varied markedly across habitats in different stages of post-fire regeneration; however, in all cases, nest sites and nesting resources were important determinants of bee community structure.},

abstract = {Constructed wetlands (CW) are considered a successful tool to treat wastewater in many countries: their success is mainly assessed observing the rate of pollution reduction, but CW can also contribute to the conservation of ecosystem services. Among the many ecosystem services provided, the biodiversity of CW has received less attention. The EcoSistema Filtro (ESF) of the Molentargius-Saline Regional Natural Park is a constructed wetland situated in Sardinia (Italy), built to filter treated wastewater, increase habitat diversity, and enhance local biodiversity. A floristic survey has been carried out yearly 1 year after the construction of the artificial ecosystem in 2004, observing the modification of the vascular flora composition in time. The flora of the ESF accounted for 54 {\%} of the whole Regional Park's flora; alien species amount to 12 {\%}; taxa of conservation concern are 6 {\%}. Comparing the data in the years, except for the biennium 2006/2007, we observed a continuous increase of species richness, together with an increase of endemics, species of conservation concern, and alien species too. Once the endemics appeared, they remained part of the flora, showing a good persistence in the artificial wetland. Included in a natural park, but trapped in a sprawling and fast growing urban context, this artificial ecosystem provides multiple uses, by preserving and enhancing biodiversity. This is particularly relevant considering that biodiversity can act as a driver of sustainable development in urban areas where most of the world's population lives and comes into direct contact with nature.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, a large number of studies have investigated the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, most of which focussed on a limited set of ecosystem variables. The Jena Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for functional biodiversity research. First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an ecosystem. About 45{\%} of different types of ecosystem processes measured in the ‘main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to 60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness, providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This highlights the need to revisit diversity–stability theory. Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not instead of, effects of plant species richness. Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was stronger for above- than for belowground organisms, and stronger for herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger than the effect on species abundances. Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g. carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant species richness than variables of the C cycle. Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment, most investigated plant traits, both above- and belowground, were plastic and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way, suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits to particular functions. Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments, supported the important role of the biotic component for element and water fluxes. Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency. Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that diverse ‘High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related services. A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the effort (in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments. To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake. Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible.},

abstract = {Constructed ecosystems are engineered to perform functions, such as bioremediation of contaminants, and are increasingly viewed as green alternatives to conventional technologies. Augmenting biodiversity of managed systems such as agroecosystems has been shown to improve yields and other functions such as nutrient uptake, but manipulation of organismal diversity linked to the functioning of constructed ecosystems is an emerging field that has not been reviewed. Here, we summarize current understandings of the relationships between biodiversity and the functions (services) of constructed ecosystems such as green roofs, sewage treatment wetlands and bioreactors, by reviewing theoretical expectations and experimental results. There are several ways in which increased plant species diversity is expected to improve functioning on green roofs. A positive effect of functional composition on water runoff retention has been demonstrated in one system. In wastewater treatment wetland systems, there are a handful of studies showing positive relationships between species diversity and nutrient uptake, but many showing no effect of species diversity. Studies on bioreactors and biofilms suggest that functional redundancy in microbial communities is a consequence of high biodiversity and can promote temporal stability in system performance. The inevitability of variable environmental conditions suggests that the insurance derived from biodiversity is likely important in most constructed ecosystems, but more experimental manipulations of biodiversity are necessary to test whether ecosystem functions can be optimized or stabilized in any system.},

abstract = {Summary 1. There is a clear need to improve our ability to assess the ecological consequences of environmental change. Because of the complexity of ecosystems and a need to disentangle the effects of multiple pressures, predictions are often reliant on models and expert opinion. These require validation with observed data; in this respect, long-term datasets are particularly valuable. 2. Innovative statistical methods (nonparametric regression and additive models) are presented for identifying nonparametric ecological trends and changes in seasonality in response to environmental change. These are illustrated through the example of Loch Leven, a shallow freshwater lake. 35 years of monitoring data are examined spanning periods of enrichment, ecological recovery and changing climate. 3. Models are developed for phosphorus and nitrogen; temperature and rainfall; Daphnia grazers; and chlorophylla with the ecological objectives to examine trends in water quality and the corresponding trends in nutrient availability, grazer abundance and climate. 4. The analysis highlighted a generally decreasing availability of phosphorus over the study period and generally increasing nonparametric trends in nitrate concentrations and rainfall. Increasing spring temperatures were also evident as were significant nonparametric changes in summer grazer densities. 5. Significant reductions in spring and summer chlorophylla are highlighted, related to the return of Daphnia to the loch. However, no response in chorophylla is apparent to the later declining trends in phosphorus, but seasonality has changed. 6. Synthesis and applications. The analysis highlights the value of nonparametric statistical models for assessing complex ecological responses to environmental change. The models outlined can examine key ecological impacts of climate change, particularly effects on the timing of seasonal events and processes. The models are illustrated using long-term water quality data from Loch Leven to explore patterns in key environmental drivers and ecological responses affecting freshwater ecosystems. Analysis of chlorophylla in particular, highlighted the value of examining the seasonal trends separately, with different trends evident for winter and spring and a changing seasonal pattern.},

abstract = {Global change drivers are rapidly altering resource availability and biodiversity. While there is consensus that greater biodiversity increases the functioning of ecosystems, the extent to which biodiversity buffers ecosystem productivity in response to changes in resource availability remains unclear. We use data from 16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources-soil nutrients or water-to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in complementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.},

abstract = {We estimated the dates of the monocot-dicot split and the origin of core eudicots using a large chloroplast (cp) genomic dataset. Sixty-one protein-coding genes common to the 12 completely sequenced cp genomes of land plants were concatenated and analyzed. Three reliable split events were used as calibration points and for cross references. Both the method based on the assumption of a constant rate and the Li-Tanimura unequal-rate method were used to estimate divergence times. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that nonsynonymous substitution rates of cp genomes are unequal among tracheophyte lineages. For this reason, the constant-rate method gave overestimates of the monocot-dicot divergence and the age of core eudicots, especially when fast-evolving monocots were included in the analysis. In contrast, the Li-Tanimura method gave estimates consistent with the known evolutionary sequence of seed plant lineages and with known fossil records. Combining estimates calibrated by two known fossil nodes and the Li-Tanimura method, we propose that monocots branched off from dicots 140-150 Myr ago (late Jurassic-early Cretaceous), at least 50 Myr younger than previous estimates based on the molecular clock hypothesis, and that the core eudicots diverged 100-115 Myr ago (Albian-Aptian of the Cretaceous). These estimates indicate that both the monocot-dicot divergence and the core eudicot's age are older than their respective fossil records.},

abstract = {Novel urban ecosystems have recently gained importance and a consensus grows that ecosystem services are linked to ecosystem properties that in turn can be predicted by functional diversity (FD) of plant communities. Ensuring quality of life in cities is essential and approaches to improve ecosystem services should be encouraged. Here we analyzed the initial plant composition of commercial extensive green roof systems in terms of FD and propose two methods to compose species lists that maximize FD. Clustering techniques grouped the systems in three green roof types that differ in species richness and composition, substrate depth and installation method. Differences in FD and species richness between the types were considerable and correlations between FD and species richness were strongly positive, suggesting that species-rich systems generally have higher FD and thus offer better ecosystem services. Green roof systems that comprise only succulents have significant lower FD values compared to systems containing more diverse vegetation. Within the green roof types there was room for improvement of FD. Based on a species trait dissimilarity matrix, species lists that maximize FD for every green roof type were created. FD analysis of novel ecosystems enables the design of both species-poor and species-rich green roof systems with improved overall ecosystem services value. The described approach is generic in nature and can be used for a broad range of novel ecosystems and urban green elements. We believe that designing functional diverse plant systems will support a more sustainable urban planning and improve the quality of urban life.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is a powerful research summarization technique. In the medical field, for example, meta-analysis is an indispensable tool as part of systematic reviews for healthcare decision making. The advantages of meta-analysis have also been recognized in the fields of ecology and conservation biology with the method becoming increasingly popular since the 1990s. “Meta-analysis”, however, is not well-defined in these fields, but is regularly confused with other summary analysis techniques, such as multiple regression methods, vote-counting or other quantitative analyses. We argue that this vague and inconsistent utilization of the term is problematic, because a meta-analysis typically provides scientifically rigorous results. We therefore advocate a consistent and well-defined usage of the term in our disciplines, based on the standardized definition applied in the medical sciences. We searched the Web of Knowledge for meta-analyses in the subject area “biodiversity conservation” and evaluated the usage of the term “meta-analysis”. Based on meta-analysis literature from the medical sciences, we determined steps that in our opinion are mandatory when performing meta-analysis and rated articles according to these steps. In the first round of rating, we assessed the usage of four “technical” steps that are normally applied in meta-analytical software. In the second round, we only evaluated the highly rated articles from the first round. We considered three steps regarding more qualitative aspects of interpretation and results presentation. Of the 133 evaluated articles in the first round, only 45{\%} fulfilled all technical requirements for a meta-analysis, while 25{\%} did not fulfill any of the requisite steps. In the second round, only one article of 83 fulfilled all requisite steps, while 22{\%} did not fulfill any requirement. Our findings highlight the ambiguous and vague usage of the term “meta-analysis” in ecology and conservation biology and underline the importance of a consistent and clear definition. We conclude with recommendations on how the term should be applied in the future. Read More: http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/ES13-00062.1},

We assessed the potential value of urban "green roofs" for native pollinator conservation in the Chicago region, comparing them with reference habitats of tallgrass prairie natural areas and traditional city-park green spaces. We found that native bees are present on green roofs, though at lower abundance and diversity than in reference habitats. Green-roof and prairie bee communities were distinct from each other, while those in parks were intermediate and similar to the other two habitat types. Bee-community patterns were related to habitat characteristics at both the site and landscape scales. Overall, bee abundance and species richness increased with greater proportions of green space in the surrounding landscape. However, this relationship disappeared in cases where green space was dominated by turf grass. At the site scale, bees benefited from greater plant diversity, and bee and plant-community composition were significantly correlated. Green roofs are potentially valuable sites for bee conservation in urban areas, particularly if planted with diverse native forbs to provide foraging resources, and designed to accommodate bees with different nesting habits. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, survival, growth and the performance of thermal and stormwater capture functions of three pairs of dryland and wetland plant species were quantified using an extensive modular green roof system.},

abstract = {1. Plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects have almost exclusively been quantified on homogeneous soils, but as different plant species will influence their local soil differently in reality PSF effects will be spatially heterogeneous. Whether plant performance in soils with spatially heterogeneous PSF can be predicted from pot experiments with homogeneous soils is unclear. 2. In a greenhouse experiment we tested the response of monocultures of six grassland species (two grasses, two legumes, and two forbs) to three spatially explicit treatments (fine-grain heterogeneity, coarse-grain heterogeneity, and homogeneous). Sixteen patches of conditioned soil ({\~{}}6x6 cm) were placed within each container. For homogeneous treatments all patches contained the same conditioned soil within a container. The fine-grained heterogeneous treatment contained four differently conditioned soils that were applied following a Latin square design, while for the coarse-grained heterogeneous treatment four contiguous square blocks of four cells each were created in each container. 3. In general species grew worse on soil conditioned by conspecifics. However, when the biomass production on all homogeneous soil treatments (own and foreign soils) was averaged and compared to the heterogeneous treatments, we found that biomass production was lower than expected in the heterogeneous soils. This effect of heterogeneity depended on both the conditioning and test species, but most heterogeneity effects were negative. The grain of the heterogeneity (coarse vs. fine: at the chosen spatial scale) did not affect plant performance. 4. We hypothesize that a more diverse soil community is present in spatially heterogeneous soils. This increases i) the chance of plants to encounter its antagonists, which may then rapidly increase in numbers; and ii) the scope for synergistic co-infections. Together this may lead to non-additive responses of plants to spatial heterogeneity in PSF. 5. Synthesis. Plant performance was lower in spatially heterogeneous soils than predicted by spatially homogeneous soils. In natural grasslands that have mixed plant communities conditioning the soil plant-soil feedback (PSF) effects on plant performance may therefore be more negative than what is predicted from pot experiments. Our results emphasise the need to incorporate the spatial dynamics of PSF both in empirical and modelling studies if we are to understand the role of PSF in plant-plant interactions and plant community dynamics.},

abstract = {Most biodiversity experiments have been conducted in grassland ecosystems with nitrogen limitation, while little research has been conducted on relationships between plant biomass production, substrate nitrogen retention and plant diversity in wetlands with continuous nitrogen supply. We conducted a plant diversity experiment in a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland for treating domestic wastewater in southeastern China. Plant aboveground biomass production ranged from 20 to 3121gm-2yr-1across all plant communities. In general, plant biomass production was positively correlated with species richness (P=0.001) and functional group richness (P=0.001). Substrate nitrate concentration increased significantly with increasing plant species richness (P=0.046), but not with functional group richness (P=0.550). Furthermore, legumes did not affect biomass production (P=0.255), retention of substrate nitrate (P=0.280) and ammonium (P=0.269). Compared to the most productive of the corresponding monocultures, transgressive overyielding of mixed plant communities did not occur in most polycultures. Because greater diversity of plant community led to higher biomass production and substrate nitrogen retention, thus we recommend that plant biodiversity should be incorporated in constructed wetlands to improve wastewater treatment efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Some agricultural practices may improve soil properties by expanding plant biodiversity. However, sustainable management of agroecosystems should be performed from a functional plant trait perspective. Advances in functional ecology, especially plant functional trait effects on ecosystem processes and services, provide pivotal knowledge for ecological intensification of agriculture; this approach acknowledges that a crop field is an agroecosystem whose ecological processes influence soil properties. We highlight the links between plant functional traits and soil properties in relation to four major ecosystem processes involved in vital ecosystem services: food production, crop protection, climate change mitigation, and soil and water conservation, aiming towards ecological intensification of sustainable agricultural and soil management.},

The purpose the study was to determine the influence of subcanopy and interspace zones on microsite characteristics and herbaceous vegetation. Study sites were located at the Northern Great Basin Experimental Range (NGBER) (56 km west of Burns, OR) and Baker Pass (80 km southeast of Burns, OR). At the NGBER, microsite and vegetation differences existed between subcanopy and interspace zones. Compared to the interspace, subcanopy zones were characterized by lower fluctuations in soil temperature, higher levels of soil organic matter, nitrogen, carbon, and water, and greater herbaceous biomass, cover, and density. A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis appears to strongly influence the spatial arrangement of herbaceous vegetation at the NGBER. Zonal vegetation differences measured at the NGBER were not found at Baker Pass, a location with a more north-facing aspect than the NBGER. Our results suggest that the influence of A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis on herbaceous spatial heterogeneity may be greater as sites become warmer and drier. Our study demonstrated the potential of A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis to create herbaceous spatial heterogeneity, elucidated that the relationships between A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis and herbaceous species are complex, and can be site specific.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wild bees are important pollinators that have declined in diversity and abundance during the last decades. Habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization are reported as part of the main causes of this decline. Urbanization involves dramatic changes of the landscape, increasing the proportion of impervious surface while decreasing that of green areas. Few studies have investigated the effects of urbanization on bee communities. We assessed changes in the abundance, species richness, and composition of wild bee community along an urbanization gradient. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Over two years and on a monthly basis, bees were sampled with colored pan traps and insect nets at 24 sites located along an urbanization gradient. Landscape structure within three different radii was measured at each study site. We captured 291 wild bee species. The abundance of wild bees was negatively correlated with the proportion of impervious surface, while species richness reached a maximum at an intermediate (50{\%}) proportion of impervious surface. The structure of the community changed along the urbanization gradient with more parasitic species in sites with an intermediate proportion of impervious surface. There were also greater numbers of cavity-nesting species and long-tongued species in sites with intermediate or higher proportion of impervious surface. However, urbanization had no effect on the occurrence of species depending on their social behavior or body size. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We found nearly a third of the wild bee fauna known from France in our study sites. Indeed, urban areas supported a diverse bee community, but sites with an intermediate level of urbanization were the most speciose ones, including greater proportion of parasitic species. The presence of a diverse array of bee species even in the most urbanized area makes these pollinators worthy of being a flagship group to raise the awareness of urban citizens about biodiversity.},

abstract = {The ruderal habitats in cities, extending from the ground level to buildings and walls, are colonized by a special flora which adds a new dimension to urban ecology and urban biodiversity. This study investigates the spontaneous arboreal flora on buildings of different configurations and ages in compact urban Hong Kong. The hanging plants' association with intrinsic building bioreceptivity traits, extrinsic environmental factors and human intervention were evaluated. Building plants in three districts with varied urban form and building type were assessed in the field. They cling on diverse microhabitats led by vertical wall faces and roof, and a group of horizontal substrates accommodating 57{\%} of the plants. The flora is dictated by the tree growth form, contributing 10 of the 11 species. Moraceae (76.2{\%}) and its seven Ficus species (74.4{\%}) are dominant. The most abundant members are pan-tropical native tree Ficus microcarpa, and the exotic but naturalized para-shrub Catharanthus roseus. Species composition on buildings is mainly native and is similar to the ground-level ruderal sites. Their successful growth on buildings is attributed to the strangler habit that is pre-adapted to grip building appendages, and the initial epiphytic existence. The host trees in their natural tropical forest abode have been substituted by buildings niches in the city. The copious fig crops are consumed by frugivorous birds and bats serving as effective dispersal agent and germination mediator. Solar access, debris pockets, damp surfaces, and leakage from drain pipes foster germination and establishment. The bioreceptivity of old buildings with poor construction materials and maintenance is enhanced by weathered substrates to facilitate colonization. Erratic shoot removal by building management has suppressed crown size of most trees. The findings improve understanding of the intricate ecological-cum-cultural dynamics and nature-in-city enrichment of a marginal but notable urban habitat, and contribute to their conservation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Invasive plants are thought to be especially capable of range shifts or expansion in response to climate change due to high dispersal and colonization abilities. Although highly invasive throughout the Intermountain West, the presence and impact of the grass Bromus tectorum has been limited at higher elevations in the eastern Sierra Nevada, potentially due to extreme wintertime conditions. However, climate models project an upward elevational shift of climate regimes in the Sierra Nevada that could favor B. tectorum expansion. This research specifically examined the effects of experimental snow depth manipulations and interannual climate variability over 5 years on B. tectorum populations at high elevation (2,175 m). Experimentally-increased snow depth had an effect on phenology and biomass, but no effect on individual fecundity. Instead an experimentally-increased snowpack inhibited population growth in 1 year by reducing seedling emergence and early survival. A similar negative effect of increased snow was observed 2 years later. However, a strong negative effect on B. tectorum was also associated with a naturally low-snow winter, when seedling emergence was reduced by 86{\%}. Across 5 years, winters with greater snow cover and a slower accumulation of degree-days coincided with higher B. tectorum seedling density and population growth. Thus, we observed negative effects associated with both experimentally-increased and naturally-decreased snowpacks. It is likely that the effect of snow at high elevation is nonlinear and differs from lower elevations where wintertime germination can be favorable. Additionally, we observed a doubling of population size in 1 year, which is alarming at this elevation.},

The past and recent survey detected 91 and 84 species, 12 species were lost and four were gained between the surveys. There was no significant change in mean numbers of species per reserve or in mean species incidences, even if the categories of the habitat association, mobility and body size were analysed separately. Contrary to these comparisons, ordination analyses indicated a significant shift in species composition in individual reserves. Species of short-sward xeric grasslands tended to be associated with the past survey, whereas species of taller grasslands and xeric scrub were associated with recent survey. These shifts were more prominent in large reserves with high proportion of natural (as opposed to urban) perimeter, connected with other reserves, having diverse topography and high plant and biotope richness. We interpret this by gradual successional changes which affect the reserves despite conservation management. Despite these changes, butterfly losses were lower than in comparable surveys recently conducted elsewhere in Central Europe, partly because major losses occurred long before the 1980s survey and partly owing to a high heterogeneity of the urban landscape surrounding the reserves. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The suggested environmental diversity (ED) site selection model maximizes ecological diversity, measured via ordination of the chosen taxa communities. Given their fundamental role in ecosystem functioning, vascular plants are chosen as the indicator taxa. We test the ED indicator model by contrasting it to the conventional site selection indicator (MS model), which maximizes the representation of species number in the indicator taxa. We demonstrate that the ED model is more cost-effective than the MS model. More importantly, while the ED selection is operative over the whole range of species, the MS selection does not work beyond the range of species, where all vascular plants become protected. Beyond that point MS indicator model cannot guide conservation efforts, which is a serious drawback. The ED model outperforms MS model also in terms of habitat conservation and taxonomic diversity. Thus, it provides an interesting selection framework for biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The persistence of species under changed climatic conditions depends on adaptations and plastic responses to these conditions and on interactions with their local plant community resulting in direct and indirect effects of changed climatic conditions. Populations at species' range margins may be especially crucial in containing a gene pool comprising adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Many species of northern European bog ecosystems reach their southern lowland range limit in central Europe. In a common-garden experiment, we experimentally assessed the impact of projected climatic changes on five bog-plant species (including peat moss Sphagnum magellanicum) sampled along a latitudinal gradient of 1400km from Scandinavia to the marginal lowland populations in Germany. Populations were cultivated in monocultures and in experimental communities composed of all five species from their local community, and exposed to five combinations of three climate treatments (warming, fluctuating water-tables, fertilization) in a southern common garden. Whereas most monocultures showed a decreasing biomass production from southern to northern origins under southern environmental conditions, in the experimental mixed-species communities, an increasing biomass production towards northern communities was observed together with a shift in interspecific interactions along the latitudinal gradient. While negative dominance effects prevailed in southern communities, higher net biodiversity effects were observed in northern subarctic communities. The combined effects of climate treatments increased biomass production in monocultures of most origins. In communities, however, overall the treatments did not result in significantly changed biomass production. Among individual treatments, water-table fluctuations caused a significant decrease in biomass production, but only in southern communities, indicating higher vulnerability to changed climatic conditions. Here, negative effects of climate treatments on graminoids were not compensated by the slightly increased growth of peat moss that benefited from interspecific interactions only in northern communities.Synthesis. We conclude that shifting interactions within multispecies communities caused pronounced responses to changed climatic conditions in wetland communities of temperate southern marginal, but not of northern subarctic origin. Therefore, future models investigating the impacts of climate change on plant communities should consider geographical variation in species interactions an important factor influencing community responses to changed climatic conditions.},

The data collected included floristic composition, plant density, plant height, air and subsurface temperatures. Three broad groups of plants were identified: trees and shrubs, common ruderals, and species often associated with marshland. Vegetation composition was similar on all roofs, although unique characteristics were noted depending on the method of construction and time since routine maintenance was conducted. The plants grew well in what appeared to be a very harsh environment. The diversity of marsh plants is directly related to problems in roof drainage. Water drains into the cracks between the styrofoam panels, and because the insulation is impermeable, moisture can remain beneath them with very little loss through evaporation. Despite air temperatures as high as 61 °C, the plants are able to take advantage of this semi-permanent water supply. The importance of gaps between adjacent roofing panels is emphasized by the linear distribution pattern of the plant cover. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Models predict that vertical gradients of foliar nitrogen (N) allocation, increasing from bottom to top of plant canopies, emerge as a plastic response to optimise N utilisation for carbon assimilation. While this mechanism has been well documented in monocultures, its relevance for mixed stands of varying species richness remains poorly understood. We used 21 naturally assembled grassland communities to analyse the gradients of N in the canopy using N allocation coefficients (K N ) estimated from the distribution of N per foliar surface area (KN-F) and ground surface area (KN-G). We tested whether: 1) increasing plant species richness leads to more pronounced N gradients as indicated by higher K N -values, 2) K N is a good predictor of instantaneous net ecosystem CO2 exchange and 3) functional diversity of leaf N concentration as estimated by Rao's Q quadratic diversity metric is a good proxy of K N . Our results show a negative (for KN-G) or no relationship (for KN-F) between species richness and canopy N distribution, but emphasize a link (positive relationship) between more foliar N per ground surface area in the upper layers of the canopy (i.e. under higher KN-G) and ecosystem CO2 uptake. Rao's Q was not a good proxy for either K N .},

abstract = {Feedbacks between soil communities and plants may determine abundance and diversity in plant communities by influencing fitness and competitive outcomes. We tested the core hypotheses of soil community feedback theory: plant species culture distinct soil communities that alter plant performance and the outcome of interspecific competition. We applied this framework to inform the repeated dominance of Solidago canadensis in old-field communities. In glasshouse experiments, we examined the effects of soil communities on four plant species' performance in monoculture and outcomes of interspecific competition. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis to infer differences in the soil communities associated with these plant species. Soil community origin had strong effects on plant performance, changed the intensity of interspecific competition and even reversed whether plant species were limited by conspecifics or heterospecifics. These plant-soil feedbacks are strong enough to upend winners and losers in classic competition models. Plant species cultured significantly different mycorrhizal fungal and bacterial soil communities, indicating that these feedbacks are likely microbiotic in nature. In old-fields and other plant communities, these soil feedbacks appear common, fundamentally alter the intensity and nature of plant competition and potentially maintain diversity while facilitating the dominance of So. canadensis.},

abstract = {Aims: The aim of this guide is to provide practical help for ecologists who analyze data from biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments. Our approach differs from others in the use of least squares-based linear models (LMs) together with restricted maximum likelihood- based mixed models (MMs) for the analysis of hierarchical data. An original data set containing diameter and height of young trees grown in monocultures, 2- or 4-species mixtures under ambient light or shade is used as an example. Methods: Starting with a simple LM, basic features of model fitting and the subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA) for significance tests are summarized. From this, more complex models are developed. We use the statistical software R for model fitting and to demonstrate similarities and complementarities between LMs and MMs. The for- mation of contrasts and the use of error (LMs) or random-effects (MMs) terms to account for hierarchical data structure in ANOVAs are explained. Important Findings: Data from biodiversity experiments can be analyzed at the level of entire plant communities (plots) and plant individuals. The basic explanatory term is species composition, which can be divided into contrasts in many ways depending on specific biological hypotheses. Typically, these contrasts code for aspects of species richness or the presence of particular species. For significance tests in ANOVAs, contrast terms generally are compared with remaining variation of the explanatory terms from which they have been ‘carved out'. Once a final model has been selected, parameters (e.g. means or slopes for fixed-effects terms and variance components for error or random-effects terms) can be estimated to indicate the direction and size of effects.

abstract = {Plant diversity strongly influences ecosystem functions and services, such as soil carbon storage. However, the mechanisms underlying the positive plant diversity effects on soil carbon storage are poorly understood. We explored this relationship using long-term data from a grassland biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) and radiocarbon ((14)C) modelling. Here we show that higher plant diversity increases rhizosphere carbon inputs into the microbial community resulting in both increased microbial activity and carbon storage. Increases in soil carbon were related to the enhanced accumulation of recently fixed carbon in high-diversity plots, while plant diversity had less pronounced effects on the decomposition rate of existing carbon. The present study shows that elevated carbon storage at high plant diversity is a direct function of the soil microbial community, indicating that the increase in carbon storage is mainly limited by the integration of new carbon into soil and less by the decomposition of existing soil carbon.},

abstract = {Studies examining the influence of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning have rarely considered water turnover, the quantitatively most important biogeochemical flux in ecosystems and a process with high sensitivity to climate warming. With a tree sapling experiment consisting of three diversity levels (1, 3, 5 species), 11 different species combinations and two soil moisture levels (moist and dry), we examined the influence of tree species diversity and species identity on stand transpiration (T) under ample and restricted water supply. We further asked whether growth in mixture leads to adaptive responses in the hydraulic system and water loss regulation in plants with heterospecific neighbors compared to plants in monoculture. In moist soil, T was on average ∼11{\%} higher in the mixtures than in the monocultures (significant net diversity effect), which can mostly be attributed to a selection effect. Overyielding in T was highest in mixtures when Tilia cordata and/or Fraxinus excelsior were present. Both species developed larger leaf areas (LA) and sapwood areas (SA) in monocultures than the other species and furthermore increased LA and SA from the monocultures to the mixtures. Thus, inherent species differences in LA and hydraulics, but also neighbor effects on these traits determined T to a large extend. In dry soil, the diversity effect on T was not larger but slightly smaller, which is not in agreement with other published studies. We conclude that differences between pure and mixed sapling assemblages in stand water consumption and drought response are mainly caused by species identity effects, while species diversity seems to be less influential.},

abstract = {Studies in experimental grasslands have shown variation in plant individual performance in response to neighbourhood diversity. To which extent these responses are due to phenotypic plasticity or genetic variation is largely unknown. We collected seed families of five herbaceous species (Cirsium oleraceum, Crepis biennis, Plantago lanceolata, Plantago media and Rumex acetosa) in monocultures and 60-species mixtures five years after establishment and replanted or transplanted the offspring into the same monocultures and 60-species mixtures. In all five species the actual environment significantly affected plant survival, growth and performance in terms of shoot biomass and investment into reproduction, indicating stronger competition for light and different levels of herbivory in mixtures as compared with monocultures. Effects of the original environment were smaller and less consistent, but indicated differential selection in monocultures vs. mixtures. The interaction between actual and original environment, corresponding to the " home" vs " away" comparison, was rarely significant, yet this was providing a first sign of local adaptation. We conclude that, for the investigated plant species, more than five growing seasons in monocultures or mixtures would be needed to better demonstrate the selection of genotypes specifically adapted to monocultures or mixtures. A faster local adaptation may have been prevented by the ability of these species to respond to variation in neighbourhood diversity to a large degree via phenotypic plasticity and other factors. {\textcopyright} 2011 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.},

abstract = {In this paper, we have reviewed how the hydraulic design of trees influences the movement of water from roots to leaves. The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

abstract = {Plant performance is determined by the balance of intra- and interspecific neighbors within an individual's zone of influence. If individuals interact over smaller scales than the scales at which communities are measured, then altering neighborhood interactions may fundamentally affect community responses. These interactions can be altered by changing the number (species richness), abundances (species evenness), and positions (species pattern) of the resident plant species, and we aimed to test whether aggregating species at planting would alter effects of species richness and evenness on biomass production at a common scale of observation in grasslands. We varied plant species richness (2, 4, or 8 species and monocultures), evenness (0.64, 0.8, or 1.0), and pattern (planted randomly or aggregated in groups of four individuals) within 1 9 1 m plots established with transplants from a pool of 16 tallgrass prairie species and assessed plot-scale biomass production and diversity over the first three growing seasons. As expected, more species-rich plots produced more bio- mass by the end of the third growing season, an effect associated with a shift from selection to complementarity effects over time. Aggregating conspecifics at a 0.25-m scale marginally reduced biomass production across all treatments and increased diversity in the most even plots, but did not alter biodiversity effects or richness–productivity relationships. Results support the hypothesis that fine- scale species aggregation affects diversity by promoting species coexistence in this system. However, results indicate that inherent changes in species neighbor- hood relationships along grassland diversity gradients may only minimally affect community (meter) – scale responses among similarly designed biodiversity– ecosystem function studies. Given that species varied in their responses to local aggregation, it may be possible to use such species-specific results to spatially design larger-scale grassland communities to achieve desired diversity and pro- ductivity responses.},

In contrast, the relationship between diversity and productivity within terrestrial and algal primary producers has been well documented in ecology. Hence, we set out to investigate, experimentally, whether diversity may also affect lipid production in micro-algae. We investigated the growth and lipid production of micro-algae using species from all major algal groups. Algae were grown in a large number of treatments differing in their diversity level. Additionally, we compared the growth and lipid production of laboratory communities to natural lake and pond phytoplankton communities of different diversity. Our results show that lipid production increased with increasing diversity in both natural and laboratory micro-algal communities. The underlying reason for the observed 'diversity-productivity' relationship seems to be resource use complementarity. We observed higher lipid production of highly diverse algal communities under the same growth and resource supply conditions compared to monocultures. Hence, the incorporation of the ecological advantages of diversity-related resource-use dynamics into algal biomass production may provide a powerful and cost effective way to improve biofuel production.},

abstract = {Plant survivorship depends on biotic and abiotic factors that vary at local and regional scales. This survivorship, in turn, has cascading effects on community composition and the physical structure of vegetation. Survivorship of native plant species is variable among populations planted in environmentally stressful habitats like urban roofs, but the degree to which factors at different spatial scales affect survivorship in urban systems is not well understood. We evaluated the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on survivorship, composition, and physical structure of two native perennial species assemblages, one characterized by a mixture of C4 grasses and forbs (Hempstead Plains, HP) and one characterized by a mixture of C3 grasses and forbs (Rocky Summit, RS), that were initially sown at equal ratios of growth forms (5:1:4; grass, N-fixing forb and non-N-fixing forb) in replicate 2-m2 plots planted on 10 roofs in New York City (New York, USA). Of 24 000 installed plants, 40{\%} survived 23 months after planting. Within-roof factors explained 71{\%} of variation in survivorship, with biotic (species identity and assemblage) factors accounting for 54{\%} of the overall variation, and abiotic (growing medium depth and plot location) factors explaining 17{\%} of the variation. Among-roof factors explained 29{\%} of variation in survivorship and increased solar radiation correlated with decreased survivorship. While growing medium properties (pH, nutrients, metals) differed among roofs there was no correlation with survivorship. Percent cover and sward height increased with increasing survivorship. At low survivorship, cover of the HP assemblage was greater compared to the RS assemblage. Sward height of the HP assemblage was about two times greater compared to the RS assemblage. These results highlight the effects of local biotic and regional abiotic drivers on community composition and physical structure of green roof vegetation. As a result, initial green roof plant composition and roof microclimate may have long-term effects on community dynamics, ecosystem function, and urban biodiversity.},
annote = {- looked at how biotic and abiotic factors affect green roof plant survivorship in NYC

RESULTS:
- different surviorship-medium depth relationships among species (some are positive, some show no trend)
- postiive height-survivorship relationship (suggests facilitation mechanism)
- positive plant cover-survivorship relationship
- positive SR-height (again, facilitation here)

DISCUSSION 

- important BIOTIC factors:
(1) intraspecific trait variation 
(2) role of root trait variation in survivorship
(3) sward height of C4 grasses in faciltation: - - higher height
- lower soil temperature 
- microclimatic effects
- facilitation

important ABIOTIC factors
(1) solar radiation (decrease water availability)
(2) atmospheric N deposition
(3) perenially speces prefer greater soil depth
(4) annual species may prefer shallow soil depth

RECOMMENDATIONS
- maintain plant cover (60{\%}): needs mix of species with different growth forms and life-history strategies
- e.g. a mix of D. spicata, P. virgatum, S. laeve, S. nemaolist, L. capitata, R.hirta, P. tenuifolium, and R . hirta},

abstract = {In soft-bottom sediments, consumers may influence ecosystem function more via engineering that alters abiotic resources than through trophic influences. Understanding the influence of bioturbation on physical, chemical, and biological processes of the water-sediment interface requires investigating top-down (consumer) and bottom-up (resource) forces. The objective of the present study was to determine how consumer bioturbation mode and sediment properties interact to dictate the hydrologie function of experimental filtration systems clogged by the deposition of fine sediments. Three fine-grained sediments characterized by different organic matter (OM) and pollu- tant content were used to assess the influence of resource type: sediment of urban origin highly loaded with OM and pollutants, river sediments rich in OM, and river sediments poor in OM content. The effects of consumer bioturbation (chironomid larvae vs. tubificid worms) on sediment reworking, changes in hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity, and water fluxes through the water-sediment interface were measured. Invertebrate influences in reducing the clogging process depended not only on the mode of bioturbation (construction of biogenic structures, burrowing and feeding activities, etc.) but also on the interaction between the bioturbation process and the sediments of the clogging layer. We present a conceptual model that highlights the importance of sediment influences on bioturbation and argues for the integration of bottom-up influence on consumer engineering activities.},

abstract = {The diversity of many communities is changing due to local extinctions and invasions. Understanding the consequences of these changes is vital to their successful conservation, yet few studies have experimentally investigated how producer diversity affects the stability of higher trophic levels. Here, we show that producer diversity, when manipulated as the only independent variable in the presence of natural top-down forces, increases the stability of consumer abundance, biomass and diversity in a benthic marine community. Using four macroalgal species (Codium fragile, Gracilaria tikvahiae, Gracilaria vermiculophylla and Gymnogongrus griffithsiae), we manipulated producer diversity (identity and richness) in a substitutive design to create seven treatments. Our treatments included four monocultures, two 3-species mixtures that differed only by including either the native or invasive Gracilaria and the complete four-species mixture. We followed the week-to-week dynamics of producer and consumer communities in each treatment concurrently for 12weeks and quantified their temporal stability. We found that higher producer diversity increased the stability of a diverse, productive consumer community.Producer biomass production did not affect consumer production or diversity, suggesting that producer diversity was solely responsible for driving the mechanisms underlying the observed multitrophic diversity-stability relationships. Taken together, our results indicate thathigher producer diversitydirectly increased consumer diversity by increasing overyielding and decreasing the temporal variance of this response variable and that this increased consumer diversity enhanced consumer stability via increased asynchrony among consumers.Synthesis. Our results suggest that the effects of producer diversity propagate upwards to maintain diversity and productivity at higher trophic levels, and thereby enhance the overall stability of food webs.},

abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and the stability and production of trophic levels continues to receive intense scientific interest. Though facilitation is commonly cited as an essential underlying mechanism, few studies have provided evidence of the impact that indirect facilitation may have on diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. In this laboratory study, we examined the effect of zooplankton species diversity on trophic structure (total algal and zooplankton biomass) and temporal stability of total zooplankton biomass. We utilized four species of pond zooplankton grown in either monoculture or in polyculture. When comparing responses in polycultures with responses averaged across monocultures, a positive effect of diversity on total zooplankton biomass was observed. This occurred as a result of positive facilitative effects among competing zooplankton. Daphnia pulex, a biomass dominant in monoculture, was negatively affected by the presence of interspecific competitors. In contrast, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, a species that performed poorly in monoculture, was strongly and positively affected by the presence of interspecific competitors, driving positive diversity effects on total zooplankton biomass. Positive temporal covariances among zooplankton were detected in several polyculture replicates, increasing temporal variability of total zooplankton biomass. However, this destabilizing effect was weak relative to effects of high biomass yields in polyculture which caused temporal biomass variability (as measured by the coefficient of variation) to be lower in polyculture relative to monocultures. Zooplankton diversity effects on total algal biomass were not detected. However, increased zooplankton diversity significantly altered the size structure of algae, increasing the relative abundance of large, grazer-resistant algae.},

abstract = {The study of the relationship between species richness of a plant community and its productivity has received much attention, recently renewed by the concern on the loss of biological diversity at a global scale. Here, we briefly review some indices widely used in agronomic and competition experiments to compare monocultures and mixtures, and compare them to other, more recently designed ones. These various indices are then calculated for two experiments. In the first experiment, two grass and two legume species were grown at six levels of nitrogen availability, either in monocultures or in mixtures of the four species in a substitutive design; in the second experiment, five grass species were grown at 16 levels of total nutrient availability, either in monocultures or in mixtures of the five species in an additive design. These data clearly show that the conclusions drawn from the experiments depend on the index used to compare the experimental communities. We argue that a clear test of whether the productivity of communities increases with species richness requires that: (1) all species present in the multispecies assemblages also be grown in monocultures under the same environmental conditions, and (2) the productivity of these assemblages be compared to the most productive monoculture. We conclude that there are as yet very few cases where superior productivity of multispecies assemblages as compared to monocultures has been clearly shown.},

abstract = {The analysis of presence-absence matrices with ''null model'' randomization tests has been a major source of controversy in community ecology for over two decades. In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F. Conner and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard combinations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do nut co-occur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not. Greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an appropriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic ''island lists'' of species in an archipelago or standardized ''sample lists'' of species collected with equal sampling effort. Systematic examination of a set of related null models can pinpoint how violation of the assumptions of the model contributes to nonrandom patterns.},

abstract = {Recent research suggests that genetic diversity in plant populations can shape the diversity and abundance of consumer communities. We tested this hypothesis in a field experiment by manipulating patches of Evening Primrose (Oenothera biennis) to contain one, four or eight plant genotypes. We then surveyed 92 species of naturally colonizing arthropods. Genetically diverse plant patches had 18{\%} more arthropod species, and a greater abundance of omnivorous and predacious arthropods, but not herbivores, compared with monocultures. The effects of genotypic diversity on arthropod communities were due to a combination of interactive and additive effects among genotypes within genetically diverse patches. Greater genetic diversity also led to a selective feedback, as mean genotype fitness was 27{\%} higher in diverse patches than in monocultures. A comparison between our results and the literature reveals that genetic diversity and species diversity can have similar qualitative and quantitative effects on arthropod communities. Our findings also illustrate the benefit of preserving genetic variation to conserve species diversity and interactions within multitrophic communities.},

abstract = {Many studies that provided evidence for a positive relationship between plant diversity and productivity have proposed that this effect may be explained by complementarity among species in resources utilization, or selection of particularly productive species in high-diversity plant communities. Recent studies have related the higher productivity in diverse plant communities to suppression of pathogenic soil biota. If soil biota plays a role in diversity–productivity relationships, the question remains about how they may influence complementarity and selection effects. Here we examine how complementarity and selection effects may depend on soil biota using a plant–soil feedback approach. We used monocultures and mixtures of early successional plant species, which are known to have mostly negative plant–soil feedback effects, and mid-successional plant species, which generally have neutral plant–soil feedback. We found that plant–soil feedback effects differed between monocultures and mixed plant communities, as well as between early and mid-successional plants. This resulted in a significant interaction effect between diversity and successional stage. In monocultures, plant–soil feedback tended to be negative for early and positive for mid-successional plant species. Interestingly, the community feedback responses of the mixed communities were opposite, being positive for early and negative for mid-successional community. Plant–soil feedback differentially affected complementarity and selection effects of early and mid-successional plant communities: it enhanced complementarity effects of early and decreased selection effects of mid-successional species. Synthesis. Soil biota that drive plant–soil feedback effects can influence the diversity–productivity relationship not only through decreased biomass production in monocultures compared to mixtures, but also through influencing complementarity and selection effects among species in mixed plant communities. Our results reveal that biodiversity–productivity relationships depend on plant–soil feedback interactions, which depend on the successional position of the plant. We propose that including successional position and trait-based analyses of plant–soil feedback in diversity-functioning studies will enhance understanding consequences of biodiversity loss for productivity and other ecosystem processes.},

The emerging carbon market provides an incentive to afforest agricultural landscapes and could potentially achieve multiple outcomes. However, planting monocultures for carbon sequestration may preclude effective delivery of other ecosystem services. Here, we describe the rationale behind the Ridgefield Multiple Ecosystem Services Experiment, a long-term investigation into trade-offs that might prevent the simultaneous provision of high levels of multiple services in the agricultural landscape of south-western Australia. We compare a monoculture treatment of a fast growing native species (Eucalyptus loxophleba) with mixtures of 2, 4 or 8 native plant species. We selected species based on different traits that we predict will relate to the provision of different levels of multiple ecosystem services. We ask: Can restoration of multiple ecosystem services be achieved along with carbon sequestration? Nested treatments of nitrogen deposition and weed removal test whether ecosystem service outcomes respond to environmental changes. We show that historical land-use at the site has the potential to affect service delivery via different soil characteristics and survival of planted species. Ridgefield tests the possibility of restoring and managing agricultural landscapes for multiple ecosystem services, providing a much needed experimental investigation of trade-offs among ecosystem functions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {(Abstract) Global warming impacts natural communities through effects on performance of individual species and through changes in the strength of interactions between them. While there is a body of evidence of the former, we lack experimental evidence on potential changes in interaction strengths. Knowledge about multispecies interactions is fundamental to understand the regulation of biodiversity and the impact of climate change on communities. This study investigated the effect of warming on a simplified community consisting of three species: rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea feeding on plantain, Plantago lanceolata, and a heterospecific neighbouring plant species, perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne. The aphid does not feed on L. perenne. The experimental design consisted of monocultures and mixtures of L. perenne and P. lanceolata at three temperature levels. We did not find indication for indirect temperature effects on D. plantaginea through changes in leaf nitrogen or relative water content. However, experimental warming affected the life history traits of the aphid directly, in a non-linear manner. Aphids performed best at moderate warming, where they grew faster and had a shorter generation time. In spite of the increased population growth of the aphids under warming, the herbivory rates were not changed and consequently the plant-herbivore interaction was not altered under warming. This suggests reduced consumption rates at higher temperature. Also plant competition affected the aphids but through an interaction with temperature. We provide proof-of-concept that net interactions between plants and herbivores should not change under warming despite direct effects of warming on herbivores when plant-plant interaction are considered. Our study stresses the importance of indirect non–trophic interactions as an additional layer of complexity to improve our understanding of how trophic interactions will alter under climate change.},

abstract = {Stable provisioning of ecosystem functions and services is crucial for human well-being in a changing world. Two essential ecological components driving vital ecosystem functions in terrestrial ecosystems are plant diversity and soil microorganisms. In this study, we tracked soil microbial basal respiration and biomass over a time period of 12 years in a grassland biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment) and examined the role of plant diversity and plant functional group composition for the spatial and temporal stability of soil microbial properties (basal respiration and biomass) in bulk-soil. Spatial and temporal stability were calculated as the inverse coefficient of variation (CV-1) of soil microbial respiration and biomass measured from soil samples taken over space and time, respectively. We found that 1) plant species richness consistently increased soil microbial properties after a time lag of four years since the establishment of the experimental plots, 2) plant species richness had minor effects on the spatial stability of soil microbial properties, whereas 3) the functional composition of plant communities significantly affected spatial stability of soil microbial properties, with legumes and tall herbs reducing both the spatial stability of microbial respiration and biomass, while grasses increased the latter, and 4) the effect of plant diversity on temporal stability of soil microbial properties turned from being negative to neutral, suggesting that the recovery of soil microbial communities from former arable land-use takes more than a decade. Our results highlight the importance of plant functional group composition for the spatial and temporal stability of soil microbial properties, and hence for microbially-driven ecosystem processes, such as decomposition and element cycling, in temperate semi-natural grassland.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Through complementarity interactions, mixed-species forests can be more productive than monocultures, and this effect can increase with tree-species richness. However, this is not always the case. This review examines the processes and stand structural attributes that can influence diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs); how they influence resource availability, resource uptake, and resource-use efficiency; and also describes some important differences between tree-diversity versus grassland-diversity experiments. The size of the complementarity effects caused by these processes and stand structures varies along spatial and temporal gradients in resource availability and climate. These spatial and temporal dynamics have now been examined in many studies, and the general patterns are summarized using a simple framework; complementarity is predicted to increase as the availability of resource “X” declines (or climatic condition X becomes harsher) if the species interactions improve the availability, uptake, or use efficiency of resource X (or interactions improve climatic condition X). Importantly, this framework differs from the stress-gradient hypothesis to account for a wider range of inter-specific plant interactions (not only facilitation) by considering contrasting methods used to quantify species interactions while accounting for stand structure. In addition, complementarity (as opposed to facilitation) for a given species combination can increase as growing conditions improve in forests, contrary to predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis with regards to facilitation. This review indicates that while the effects of tree-species diversity on growth and other forest functions are now receiving a lot of attention, far less is known about the effects of structural diversity on growth or forest functioning. Direct measurements of the processes, as opposed to focusing mainly on growth responses, could greatly contribute to our understanding of structural diversity effects.},

abstract = {Few manipulative experiments that explicitly test the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function have focussed on regenerative processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Of the studies that have taken place, most have concentrated on the effects of leaf litter diversity rather than the effects of consumer diversity on decomposition. In the present study, we established an in-situ mesocosm experiment on an intertidal mudflat in the Ythan Estuary, Scotland, to investigate the interactive effects of consumer diversity, resource diversity and microbial activity on algal consumption and decomposition. We assembled communities of three commonly occurring macrofaunal species (Hediste diversicolor, Hydrobia ulvae and Littorina littorea) in monoculture and all possible combinations of two and three species mixtures and supplied them with single vs two-species mixtures of the algae Fucus spiralis and Ulva intestinalis. Further, we also investigated whether algal decomposition changes nutrient remineralisation within the sediment by determining the C:N ratio of the surficial sediment. Data were analysed using extended linear regression with generalized least squares estimation to characterise the variance structure. We found that consumer species diversity effects are best explained by compositional effects and that species richness per se may not be the single most important determinant of resource use and decomposition in this community. Algal identity and invertebrate identity effects underpin the observed response and reflect species-specific traits associated with algal consumption and processing. The role of the microbial community is comparatively weak, but strongly linked to faunal activities and behaviour. The C:N ratio of the sediment increased with consumer species richness, indicating increased mineralisation in more diverse communities. Overall, our results suggest that although consumer species richness effects per se are weak, decomposition and subsequent incorporation of resources is nevertheless dependent on the composition of the decomposer community, which, in turn, has important implications for biogeochemical nutrient cycling in marine coastal habitats.},

abstract = {1. Many factors shape plant reproductive patterns including climate, competition or attraction of pollinators and seed dispersers, flower and fruit morphologies and phylogenetic relationships. South American Myrtaceae (Myrteae) were chosen to evaluate hypotheses on how abiotic and biotic factors, morphology and phylogeny influence plant reproductive phenology. 2. We examined whether Myrteae reproductive patterns are seasonal and related to climate; whether aggregated or segregated flowering and fruiting occur among species sharing pollinators or seed dispersers; the relationship between phenological and morphological traits, time of reproduction and Myrteae phylogenetic history; and the shared influence of ecological (environmental) and phylogenetic factors on Myrteae reproductive patterns. 3. We observed flowering and fruiting of 34 Myrteae species during 30 months in an Atlantic rain forest (south-eastern Brazil). We employed circular statistics to test for seasonality and multiple regressions to relate climate and phenology. Competition and facilitation hypotheses were tested using null models. We quantified the phylogenetic signal on phenology and morphology of Myrteae species using phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) analyses, and used PVR and partial regressions to quantify the influences of ecology and phylogeny on phenology. 4. Myrteae flowered seasonally, whereas fruiting was not seasonal. Environmental factors (day-length and temperature) and associations with biotic vectors through facilitation hypothesis explained the aggregated blossom. Fruit maturation time affected the species' flowering sequence. Plants with longer fruit maturation times flowered at the end of the appropriate season, explaining the continuous fruit availability despite the seasonal flowering. The random fruiting pattern explained the regular presence of seed dispersers. Myrteae phenology was phylogenetically structured, even when phenophases were not seasonal, i.e., closer related species fruited under more similar environmental conditions, suggesting that the reproductive phenological niche was inherited along the course of evolution. We detected a shared influence of ecology and phylogeny on Myrteae phenological responses, and the ecological component explained better phenological variation than phylogeny. 5. Synthesis. We provided a new perspective on plant phenology based on phylogeny and ecology and demonstrated the importance of considering their shared influence in phenological studies. Our analyses can be employed for the most representative families of highly diverse ecosystems to improve our understanding of evolutionary patterns and general trends in phenology.},

abstract = {The intrinsic growth rate of non-selective microbivores increases asymptotically with increasing prey biomass, but we do not know how intrinsic growth rate is affected by prey richness. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of prey richness on the growth kinetics of nematode predators while grazing on mixed bacterial lawns. We found that the intrinsic growth rate of Caenorhabditis elegans in laboratory culture increased asymptotically with prey richness. The mechanism of this pattern was primarily due to the best available prey species in the mixture: the intrinsic growth rate of the consumer feeding on a mixture of prey was approximately equal to the intrinsic growth rate of the predator when feeding on the single best prey in monoculture. This was analogous to the selection effect observed in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Generation time, and not reproductive output, was the life history trait component that was most consistent with the pattern of intrinsic growth rate. Our results suggest that in order to link invertebrate consumers' growth rates to their microbial species composition in the field, it will be necessary to determine the ability of microbivorous invertebrates to selectively forage in natural environments and to better understand the micro-scale distribution of microbial communities in their natural environments.},

abstract = {The impact of species richness and functional diversity of plants on ecosystem water vapor fluxes has been little investigated. To address this knowledge gap, we combined a lysimeter setup in a controlled environment facility (Ecotron) with large ecosystem samples/monoliths originating from a long-term biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) and a modeling approach. Our goals were (1) quantifying the impact of plant species richness (four vs. 16 species) on day- and nighttime ecosystem water vapor fluxes; (2) partitioning ecosystem evapotranspiration into evaporation and plant transpiration using the Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) energy partitioning model; and (3) identifying the most parsimonious predictors of water vapor fluxes using plant functional-trait-based metrics such as functional diversity and community weighted means. Daytime measured and modeled evapotranspiration were significantly higher in the higher plant diversity treatment, suggesting increased water acquisition. The SW model suggests that, at low plant species richness, a higher proportion of the available energy was diverted to evaporation (a non-productive flux), while, at higher species richness, the proportion of ecosystem transpiration (a productivity-related water flux) increased. While it is well established that LAI controls ecosystem transpiration, here we also identified that the diversity of leaf nitrogen concentration among species in a community is a consistent predictor of ecosystem water vapor fluxes during daytime. The results provide evidence that, at the peak of the growing season, higher leaf area index (LAI) and lower percentage of bare ground at high plant diversity diverts more of the available water to transpiration, a flux closely coupled with photosynthesis and productivity. Higher rates of transpiration presumably contribute to the positive effect of diversity on productivity.},

abstract = {Native prairie species have been both promoted and questioned in their ability to serve as vegetative covers for green roofs. The green roof environment with its exposure to intense sun and wind and limited moisture restricts the capacity for a large diversity of species. The result has been, in many cases, a standard, low-diversity mix of Sedum species often focused on ornament and minimizes the potential for wider environmental benefits. We reviewed the ecological literature on prairie and grassland communities with specific reference to habitat templates from stressed environmental conditions and examined analogs of prairie-based vegetation on twenty-one existing green roofs. We found that many, but not all prairie and grassland species will survive and thrive on green roofs, especially when irrigated as needed or given adequate growing medium depth. We raise several important questions about media, irrigation, temperature, biodiversity and their interactions needing more study.},

abstract = {Positive diversity-productivity relationships have repeatedly been found in experimental grassland plots, but mechanistic explanations are still under debate. We tested whether complementarity for the exploitation of the soil water resource helps to explain these relationships. In the dry summer of 2003, evapotranspiration (ET) was assessed at the Swedish BIODEPTH site using two different approaches: snapshot measurements of canopy surface temperature and simulation of time-accumulated ET by means of a soil water balance model. More diverse plots were characterized by lower surface temperatures and higher accumulated ET. Transgressive overyielding tests revealed that ET in polycultures was higher than in the best-performing monocultures, but this pattern was reversed at high degrees of water stress. Our results indicate that a more complete exploitation of soil water by more diverse grassland systems is on the one hand likely to be a driver for their increased biomass production, but on the other hand causes the more diverse communities to be affected earlier by drought. Nevertheless, the results also suggest that productivity may (at least partially) be maintained under dry conditions due to the higher likelihood of including drought-tolerant species in the more diverse communities.},

abstract = {Green roofs are a technology with a long tradition however, today are considered one of the most innovative developments for urban greening and constitute an opportunity for creating additional habitat for birds in the cities. Green roofs provide water and food mainly throughout insects, berries and seeds for feeding birds. Also provide space and cover that protect birds and their nests from predators. However, not all green roofs have the same ecological valueor equally favour the breeding of birds. It depends on the type of green roof, design, selected vegetation and maintenance. This encourages bird presence including of endangered species that permits urban people to obtain benefits such as aesthetic and psychological, ecological and some utilitarian ones. Conversely at the same time birds can damage plants that vegetate on green roofs especially in its establishment phase when the vegetated structure is more fragile or more rarely can act as disease reservoirs or cause accidents, e.g., mthe airport environments. Despite the worldwide increasing wide spread of green roofs in the last decades unhl now little attention has been paid to bird populations in relation to this kind of urban greening and few specific studies have been undertaken. This study carries out a broad review on green roofs as a habitat for birds in the urban environments and proposes a standardised methodology aimed at studying bird population on green roofs. {\textcopyright} Medwell Journals, 2010.},

abstract = {Productivity-diversity relationships are routinely described mainly in terms of species richness. However, these relationships can be affected by the functional strategy and physiological plasticity characterizing each species as they respond to environment and management changes. This study, therefore, aimed to analyze species interactions in grass communities presenting the same number of species (n = 6) but different growth strategies, and the impact on community productivity across several forms of field management (two different fertilizer application rates, i.e. 120 and 360 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), and two cutting frequencies, i.e. 3 and 6 cuts per year). For this purpose, we applied the tripartite partitioning method introduced for the analysis of biodiversity effects (BE). Grass species were cultivated on small plots (4.2 m(2)) in both mixtures and monocultures. Different management regimes altered both net BE and its component effects: dominance and potential for complementarity. A higher cutting frequency significantly reduced net BE, via a reduction in dominance effect. We found that increased N supply could either increase or decrease complementary effect according to grass mixture composition, i.e. species strategy. Regardless of management intensity, net BE was in general significantly positive especially when including individual species-specific plasticity effects. We conclude that a combination of different grasses has a positive effect on community biomass. Furthermore, both the functional strategy and the functional plasticity of component species play an important role in the intensity of BE. Therefore, biological mechanisms leading to enhanced biomass in six-grass communities are as effective for productivity as management conditions.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Understanding ecosystem responses to plant species loss is essential for the optimal management of grasslands. Recent studies have examined the effects of simulated random species loss in experimental plant communities but not those of realistic non-random species loss resulting from transient extinction pressures in semi-natural grasslands. 2. To investigate the potential effects of non-random species loss on grassland productivity, we established mesocosms with mixed communities comprising 15 plant species, and exposed them to 2 years of high-intensity management (an extinction phase) followed by 2 years of low-intensity management (a restoration phase) allowing recolonization from differentially managed neighbouring plots. In addition, monocultures of each component species were subject to the same extinction-restoration phases. 3. During the extinction phase, species with high monoculture biomass had lower extinction probabilities in the mixed community than species with low monoculture biomass, but there was also species-specific variation. The species that were most productive or most persistent during the extinction phase were not the same as those performing best in the restoration phase. 4. No consistent effects of spontaneous recolonization from neighbouring communities on species richness or productivity of the focal communities were observed during the restoration phase. 5. We estimated that extinction of all but the species with the lowest extinction risk reduced biomass productivity by 42-49{\%}; loss of all but the four species with the lowest extinction risk reduced it by 2-35{\%}. Identical calculations for a random extinction scenario yielded reductions of 52{\%} and 26-54{\%}, respectively. 6. Synthesis and applications. Prediction of the effects of species loss on plant production and on other aspects of ecosystem functioning in semi-natural grasslands must account for both specific non-random extinction processes and post-extinction conditions. For European mesic grasslands experiencing a shift from high-intensity to low-intensity management, our results suggest that recolonization by 'missing' species must be actively assisted if high production is a management objective.},

abstract = {* Species interactions in diverse plant communities affect community-scale functions such as above-ground biomass production, diversity and invasion resistance. While the strength of these formative interactions can be affected by the balance of inter- and intraspecific interactions among the resident species, it is unclear over what distances individuals typically interact in grasslands and whether or not species interactions at seeding can be effectively manipulated to improve these responses.   * In a three-year study, we tested whether manipulating the size of seeded species patches affected above-ground biomass, diversity and invasion resistance in experimentally restored grassland plots (16 m2). Plots were divided into patches that were 1, 0.5, 0.25 or 0.125 m on a side, and the equivalent of 1 m2 in each plot was seeded with one of 16 grassland species (1728 seeds m−2). A final treatment involved mixing and broadcasting all seeds into an undivided plot to mimic typical restoration approaches.   * Using successively smaller initial seed patches resulted in plots that were less diverse and initially more productive (˜25{\%} difference in second-year biomass production) than larger patch counterparts. Smaller patch plots also had a greater selection effect and experienced increases in resident species connectivity, suggesting that diversity declines and productivity gains resulted from the enhanced establishment and spread of more productive seeded species.   * Plots seeded with larger patches of the resident species were initially more invaded than those seeded with smaller patches, but this effect diminished over time. This likely reflects the ability of the non-seeded species to more effectively colonize larger patches with poor seeded species establishment.   * Mixed seeding plots were most similar to the smallest patch plots in their metrics of resident species spatial pattern, diversity and invasion resistance. However, these plots were initially less productive and had a weaker selection effect, which reflects a different compositional outcome, than the structured seeding plots.   * Synthesis. Species interact over sub-metre scales in establishing tallgrass prairie and, once established, their patterns may change over time. Given these dynamics, structured seeding approaches may be used over traditional mixed seeding approaches to control species dominance and preserve seeded species diversity within grassland systems.},

abstract = {Amount of semi-natural habitats (permanent grasslands, woodlands and hedgerows) and their level of fragmentation are among the main determinants of wild bee diversity in agricultural landscapes. However, their impact on the distribution of bee ecological traits has received little attention. In this study, we aimed to explore whether changes in the distribution of bee ecological traits along gradients of habitat amount and fragmentation were due to a direct effect of landscape context on multiple traits ('response traits') or to a correlation of response traits with other ecological traits not involved in the response of bee species to landscape context. In two study regions in southwest France and southeast Australia, we used a RLQ analysis (three-table ordination method) to link bee traits with habitat amount and fragment isolation measured at the landscape scale. We found that bee ecological traits shifted at the community-level in association with landscape gradients, whereas species-level associations among bee traits and phylogenetic clustering in bee communities were of only minor importance in determining such shifts. We found that traits such as body size and nest location were closely linked to habitat amount and fragmentation. We also observed regionally-specific relationships among ecological traits, suggesting that the regional species pool can play an important role in determining the response of bee communities to habitat amount and fragmentation. Our findings suggest that improved knowledge about how trait-based responses mediate the impact of landscapes on wild bee communities will allow better prediction and understanding of subsequent effects on ecosystem functioning.},

While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi- Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

abstract = {Living roots and their rhizodeposits can stimulate microbial activity and soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition up to several folds. This so-called rhizosphere priming effect (RPE) varies widely among plant species possibly due to species-specific differences in the quality and quantity of rhizodeposits and other root functions. However, whether the RPE is influenced by plant inter-species interactions remains largely unexplored, even though these interactions can fundamentally shape plant functions such as carbon allocation and nutrient uptake.In a 60-day greenhouse experiment, we continuously labeled monocultures and mixtures of sunflower, soybean and wheat with 13C-depleted CO2 and partitioned total CO2 efflux released from soil at two stages of plant development for SOM- and root-derived CO2. The RPE was calculated as the difference in SOM-derived CO2 between the planted and the unplanted soil, and was compared among the monocultures and mixtures.We found that the RPE was positive under all plants, ranging from 43{\%} to 136{\%} increase above the unplanted control. There were no significant differences in RPE at the vegetative stage. At the flowering stage however, the RPE in the soybean-wheat mixture was significantly higher than those in the sunflower monoculture, the sunflower-wheat mixture, and the sunflower-soybean mixture. These results indicated that the influence of plant inter-specific interactions on the RPE is case-specific and phenology-dependent. To evaluate the intensity of inter-specific effects on priming, we calculated an expected RPE for the mixtures based on the RPE of the monocultures weighted by their root biomass and compared it to the measured RPE under mixtures. At flowering, the measured RPE was significantly lower for the sunflower-wheat mixture than what can be expected from their monocultures, suggesting that RPE was significantly reduced by the inter-species effects of sunflower and wheat. In summary, our results clearly demonstrated that inter-species interactions can significantly modify rhizosphere priming on SOM decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria.

abstract = {Four wetland plant species (Scirpus validus, Carex lacustris, Phalaris arundinacea, and Typha latifolia) were grown in monoculture and as a four-species mixture to compare effectiveness of nutrient removal in controlled 18.93-l outdoor subsurface treatment wetland microcosms. A nutrient treatment that mimicked single-resident domestic effluent consisted of two levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [low (56 mg/l N and 31 mg/l P) and high (112 mg/l N and 62 mg/l P)] of nutrient solution applied three times weekly. The plants were established and maintained for one year before the nutrient treatment and monthly water sampling commenced; water sampling began July 31, 2001 and ended October 23, 2001. We tested four hypotheses: (1) vegetated microcosms are more effective at reducing concentrations of total N and total P from soil leachate than unvegetated, (2) there is a differential species effect on the potential to reduce N and P, (3) plant mixtures are more effective than monocultures at reducing N and P, and (4) the microcosms will be least effective at reducing N and P concentrations in October compared to August. We found support for hypotheses 1, 2, and 4, but our results are inconclusive for the third hypothesis. Total N and total P in the soil leachate were significantly higher from unvegetated microcosms compared to vegetated. S. validus was most effective and P. arundinacea was generally least effective at reducing N and P in monocultures, with treatment capabilities similar to unvegetated microcosms. The four-species mixture was generally highly effective at nutrient removal, however the results were not significantly different from the monocultures. At the end of the growing season (October) treatment efficiency was significantly less than earlier months, especially for the unvegetated treatment. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecological mechanisms underlying these impacts are well studied, but the role of evolutionary processes is rarely assessed. Using a long-term field experiment, we tested whether natural selection in plant communities increased biodiversity effects on productivity. We re-assembled communities with 8- year co-selection history adjacent to communities with identical species composition but no his- tory of co-selection (‘na€ ıve communities'). Monocultures, and in particular mixtures of two to four co-selected species, were more productive than their corresponding na€ ıve communities over 4 years in soils with or without co-selected microbial communities. At the highest diversity level of eight plant species, no such differences were observed. Our findings suggest that plant commu- nity evolution can lead to rapid increases in ecosystem functioning at low diversity but may take longer at high diversity. This effect was not modified by treatments simulating co-evolutionary processes between plants and soil organisms. Keywords},

abstract = {From an ecological perspective, urban green roofs can be viewed as green islands embedded in an urban matrix. Island biogeography theory suggests that species richness on an island is the outcome of dynamic equilibrium between immigration and extinction. Immigration is affected by the size of an island and distance of an island from a colonizing source. In the context of green roofs, building height and horizontal distance from green areas can potentially be a lim- iting factor for many species. Here, we considered two dis- tance components of green roofs - vertical (building height) and horizontal (distance of building from open green areas). Based on island biogeography theory, we would expect spe- cies richness or community similarity to be negatively related to horizontal or vertical distances from colonizing sources. The green roof literature addressing such questions is current- ly sparse. In our review comprised of 10 studies, we were unable to identify consistent statistically significant richness- distance or community similarity-distance (vertical or hori- zontal) relationships. The absence of statistically significant relationships could be due in large part to lowstatistical power as a consequence of both the paucity of roofs and limited range of vertical distances in many of the existing studies. In addition, these roofs differ in numerous aspects (e.g. roof size, age, substrate type, plant composition and building height). The low number of replicates, combined with the lack of ho- mogeneity among replicates combines to reduce statistical power and our ability to detect differences.},

abstract = {Due to their potential to enhance soil biodiversity and fertility, tree-based intercropping (TBI) systems are recognized as promising agrotechnologies. However, few studies have examined the effects of TBI on the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. To investigate this aspect, and to compare TBI with a more typical forest plantation (FO) system, a field experiment using soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. SO3-W4) and poplar (Populus nigra L. × P. maximowiczii cv. A. Henry 'Max 5') was conducted on an arable field site in southwestern Qu{\'{e}}bec. The species of AM fungi colonizing the roots were assessed by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequence analyses of SSU rRNA genes. A total of 13 different phylotypes were identified. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that these belonged to the genera Glomus (11), Acaulospora (1) and Scutellospora (1). The AM fungal diversity, as expressed by the Shannon-Wiener indices, were 0.82 ± 0.08 for the soybean and 0.70 ± 0.11 for poplar under the TBI system, and 0.53 ± 0.08 for poplar under the FO system. The study also investigated the distribution of AM fungal spores in the soil, and this differed in the two systems. Under the TBI system, spore abundance increased with increasing distance from the poplar trunk, while it remained relatively constant under the FO system. Our results also show that neighbouring trees and soybean plants hosted different AM fungal communities, suggesting that TBI systems may enhance AM fungal richness compared to monocultures. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding the role of diversity in the functioning of ecosystems has important implications for agriculture. Previous agricultural research has shown that crop rotation and the use of cover crops can lead to increases in yield relative to monoculture; however, few studies have been performed within the broader context of diversity–ecosystem function theory and in the absence of chemical inputs. We performed a field experiment in SW Michigan, USA, in which we manipulated the number of crop species grown in rotation and as winter cover crops over a 3-year period to test if varying the number of species in a rotation affected grain yield, a critical metric of ecosystem function in row-crops. The experimental design was unique in that no fertilizer or pesticides were used, and the only management variable manipulated was number of species in the rotation, thus providing a strong comparison to grassland diversity–ecosystem function experiments. Treatments included continuous monocultures of three row-crops, corn Zea mays L., soybean Glycine max (L.) Merr., and winter wheat Triticum aestivum L., and 2- and 3-year annual rotations with and without cover crops (zero, one, or two legume/small grain species), encompassing a range of crop diversity from one to six species. Crop yields and weed biomass were measured annually for 3 years and plant available soil nitrogen was measured over the course of the growing season in the final year of the study. In all 3 years, corn grain yield increased linearly in response to the number of crops in the rotation. Corn yields in the highest diversity treatment (three crops, plus three cover crops) were over 100{\%} higher than in continuous monoculture and were not significantly different from the county average for each of the 3 years despite the absence of chemical inputs. Corn yields in the diversity treatments were strongly correlated with the availability of inorganic soil nitrogen, which was likely influenced by the number of different legume species (crops and cover crops) present in the rotation. In soybean and winter wheat, yield differences among crop diversity treatments were also significant, but of lower magnitude (32 and 53{\%}, respectively), and showed little direct relationship to the number of crop species grown in a rotation. Results demonstrate that agricultural research motivated by ecological theory can provide important insights into the functioning of agroecosystems and enhance our understating of the linkages between diversity and ecosystem function. Importantly, these results suggest that reduced chemical inputs do not necessarily result in yield penalties and provide support for incorporation of crop or species diversity when determining how ecosystem services can be included in food, fiber, and biofuel production.},

abstract = {* Ecological and evolutionary processes historically have been assumed to operate on significantly different time-scales. We know now from theory and work in experimental and model systems that these processes can feed back on each other on mutually relevant time-scales. * Here, we present evidence of a soil-mediated eco-evolutionary feedback on the population dynamics of an invasive biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata. * As populations age, natural selection drives down production of A. petiolata's important antimycorrhizal allelochemical, sinigrin. This occurs due to density-dependent selection on sinigrin, which is favoured under interspecific, but disfavoured under intraspecific, competition. * We show that population stochastic growth rates ($\lambda$S) and plant densities are positively related to sinigrin concentration measured in seedling roots. This interaction is mediated by sinigrin's positive effect on seedling and summer survival, which are important drivers of $\lambda$S. * Together, these illustrate how the evolution of a trait shaped by natural selection can influence the ecology of a species over a period of just years to decades, altering its trajectory of population growth and interactions with the species in the soil and plant communities it invades. * Our findings confirm the predictions that eco-evolutionary feedbacks occur in natural populations. Furthermore, they improve our conceptual framework for projecting future population growth by linking the variation in plant demography to a critical competitive trait (sinigrin) whose selective advantages decrease as populations age.},

abstract = {1.Plant diversity enhances many ecosystem functions, including root biomass production which drives soil carbon input. Although root decomposition accounts for a large proportion of carbon input for soil, little is known about plant diversity effect on this process. Plant diversity may affect root decomposition in two non-exclusive ways: by providing roots of different substrate quality (e.g. root chemistry) and/or by altering the soil environment (e.g. microclimate).2.To disentangle these two pathways, we conducted three decomposition experiments using a litter-bag approach in a grassland biodiversity experiment. We hypothesised that: 1) plant species richness negatively affects substrate quality (indicated by increased C:N ratios), which we tested by decomposing roots collected from each experimental plot in one common plot; 2) plant species richness positively affects soil environment (indicated by increased soil water content), which we tested by decomposing standardised roots in all experimental plots; 3) the overall effect of plant species richness on root decomposition, due to the contrast between quality and environmental effects, is neutral, which we tested by decomposing community roots in their ‘home' plots.3.Plant species richness negatively affected root decomposition in all three experiments. The negative effect of plant species richness on substrate quality was largely explained by increased root C:N ratios along the diversity gradient. Functional group presence explained more variance in substrate quality than species richness. Here, the presence of grasses negatively affected substrate quality and root C:N ratios while the presence of legumes and small herbs had positive effects. Plant species richness had a negative effect on soil environment despite its positive effect on soil water content which is known to stimulate decomposition. We argue that – instead of soil water content - a combined effect of soil temperature and seasonality might drive environmental effect of plant diversity on decomposition in our plant communities, but this remains to be tested.4.Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that both substrate quality and soil environment contribute to the net negative effect of plant diversity on root decomposition. This study promotes our mechanistic understanding of increased soil carbon accumulation in more diverse grassland plant communities.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

Resource pulsing is a special form of environmental variation, and the general theory of coexistence in variable environments suggests specific mechanisms by which rainfall variability might contribute to the maintenance of high species diversity in arid ecosystems. In this review, we discuss physiological, morphological, and life-history traits that facilitate plant survival and growth in strongly water-limited variable environments, outlining how species differences in these traits may promote diversity. Our analysis emphasizes that the variability of pulsed environments does not reduce the importance of species interactions in structuring communities, but instead provides axes of ecological differentiation between species that facilitate their coexistence. Pulses of rainfall also influence higher trophic levels and entire food webs. Better understanding of how rainfall affects the diversity, species composition, and dynamics of arid environments can contribute to solving environmental problems stemming from land use and global climate change.},

abstract = {1.The sum of Akaike weights (SW) is often used to quantify relative variable importance (RVI) within the information-theoretic (IT) multimodel inference framework. A recent study (Galipaud et al. 2014, Methods in Ecology and Evolution 5: 983-991) questioned the validity of the SW approach. Regrettably, this study is flawed because SW was evaluated with an inappropriate benchmark. Irrespective of this study's methodological issues, RVI metrics based on the relative contribution of explanatory variables in explaining the variance in the response variable (partitioned R2-based) are lacking in multimodel inference. 2.We re-evaluated the validity of SW by repeating Galipaud et al.'s experiment but with an appropriate benchmark. When explanatory variables are uncorrelated, the quantity that SW estimates (i.e., the probability that a variable is included in the actual best IT model) is monotonically related to squared zero-order correlation coefficients (r2) between explanatory variables and the response variable. The degree of correspondence between SW and r2 rankings (not values) of variables in datasets with uncorrelated explanatory variables was therefore used as a benchmark to evaluate the validity of SW as a RVI metric. To address the lack of partitioned R2-based RVI metrics in multimodel inference, we proposed 2 metrics: (a) Iweighted, the average model probability-weighted partitioned R2; and (b) Ibest, the partitioned R2 derived from the best IT model. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations to evaluate the utility of Iweighted and Ibest versus partitioned R2 derived from the global model (Iglobal). 3.SW rankings matched r2 rankings of variables; therefore SW is a valid measure of RVI. Among partitioned R2-based metrics, Iweighted and Iglobal were generally more accurate in estimating the population partitioned R2. Iweighted performed better when explanatory variables were uncorrelated whereas Iglobal was better in smaller datasets with correlated explanatory variables. To improve the utility of Iweighted in such datasets, we proposed approaches to eliminate or reduce the influence of correlated variables. 4.Despite recent criticisms, our results show that SW is a valid RVI metric. To quantify RVI in terms of the R2 explained by each variable, Iweighted and Iglobal are the preferred RVI metrics. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. Models predict that the duration and intensity of drought will increase under future climate regimes. Although semi-arid grasslands are adapted to moisture limitation, the sensitivity of semi-arid grassland vegetation to extreme and sustained dry periods that may occur in the future has not been tested. 2. In this study, we analysed vegetation cover data from an 11-year drought manipulation in the semi-arid shortgrass steppe in Colorado, USA. We examined changes in total vegetation cover, dominant plant (Bouteloua gracilis) cover and ruderal cover in plots receiving 25{\%} and 50{\%} of ambient precipitation during the growing season. 3. We found that 11years of drought resulted in large reductions in total cover and cover of the dominant species, but significant differences did not emerge until the 4th and 7th year of drought. Drought severity significantly influenced the degree to which ruderal cover increased in the later period of the drought, but reductions in B. gracilis cover under drought were not significantly different under different drought severities. Bouteloua gracilis reduction did correspond strongly with increases in ruderal cover and species richness, suggesting that the dominant species plays a strong role in maintaining the structure of communities in the shortgrass steppe. 4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the shortgrass steppe, and most notably the dominant species B. gracilis, can be significantly perturbed by long-term droughts that may be more common in future decades. By quantifying the resistance-limit of a drought-tolerant system, our results can inform theories of stability and management decisions for grassland systems under new climate regimes and provide a new temporal context for previous and future manipulation studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {The cosmopolitan common reed (Phragmites australis) has been expanding into previously unoccupied wetland habitats throughout North America. This invasion by a non-native haplotype of Phragmites has become a major concern due to a reduction in plant diversity, reduction of faunal biodiversity, and changes in ecosystem structure. A randomized complete block design was used to compare the efficacy of two herbicides, glyphosate (Rodeo, Dow AgroSciences, IN, U.S.A.) and imazapyr (Habitat, BASF Corporation, NC, U.S.A.), on 1-ha Phragmites monoculture in a shallow borrow pit. Six foliar experimental treatments were applied consisting of (1) 2{\%} glyphosate formulation, June application; (2) 2{\%} glyphosate formulation, September application; (3) 2{\%} imazapyr formulation, June application; (4) 2{\%} imazapyr formulation, September application; (5) 5{\%} imazapyr formulation, June application; and (6) 5{\%} imazapyr, September application. Experimental plots were monitored yearly for two years after treatment. Relative importance values (RIV) were determined to assess the efficacy of herbicide treatments. We report that imazapyr foliar application is statistically superior to glyphosate in reducing Phragmites RIV, with no significant differences between the 2 and 5{\%} formulations. Both herbicides are more effective in reducing Phragmites RIV if applied early in the growing season (June). No significant differences in non-Phragmites plant recolonization were observed between herbicide treatments over the two-year time course. These results suggest that imazapyr is superior in reducing Phragmites RIV, and that earlier applications of herbicides may be more effective on Phragmites. However, managers must note that adjacent nontarget plant species may be negatively affected by earlier treatments.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of herbivory for the structure and functioning of species-rich forests, little is known about how herbivory is affected by tree species richness, and more specifically by random vs. non-random species loss. We assessed herbivore damage and its effects on tree growth in the early stage of a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China that features random and non-random extinction scenarios of tree mixtures numbering between one and 24 species. In contrast to random species loss, the non-random extinction scenarios were based on the tree species' local rarity and specific leaf area - traits that may strongly influence the way herbivory is affected by plant species richness. Herbivory increased with tree species richness across all scenarios and was unaffected by the different species compositions in the random and non-random extinction scenarios. Whereas tree growth rates were positively related to herbivory on plots with smaller trees, growth rates significantly declined with increasing herbivory on plots with larger trees. Our results suggest that the effects of herbivory on growth rates increase from monocultures to the most species-rich plant communities and that negative effects with increasing tree species richness become more pronounced with time as trees grow larger. Synthesis. Our results indicate that key trophic interactions can be quick to become established in forest plantations (i.e. already 2.5 years after tree planting). Stronger herbivory effects on tree growth with increasing tree species richness suggest a potentially important role of herbivory in regulating ecosystem functions and the structural development of species-rich forests from the very start of secondary forest succession. The lack of significant differences between the extinction scenarios, however, contrasts with findings from natural forests of higher successional age, where rarity had negative effects on herbivory. This indicates that the effects of non-random species loss could change with forest succession.},

abstract = {People depend on benefits provided by ecological systems. Understanding how these ecosystem services - and the ecosystem properties underpinning them - respond to drivers of change is therefore an urgent priority. We address this challenge through developing a novel risk-assessment framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary perspectives on functional traits to determine species{\&}apos; effects on ecosystems and their tolerance of environmental changes. We define Specific Effect Function (SEF) as the per-gram or per capita capacity of a species to affect an ecosystem property, and Specific Response Function (SRF) as the ability of a species to maintain or enhance its population as the environment changes. Our risk assessment is based on the idea that the security of ecosystem services depends on how effects (SEFs) and tolerances (SRFs) of organisms - which both depend on combinations of functional traits - correlate across species and how they are arranged on the species{\&}apos; phylogeny. Four extreme situations are theoretically possible, from minimum concern when SEF and SRF are neither correlated nor show a phylogenetic signal, to maximum concern when they are negatively correlated (i.e., the most important species are the least tolerant) and phylogenetically patterned (lacking independent backup). We illustrate the assessment with five case studies, involving both plant and animal examples. However, the extent to which the frequency of the four plausible outcomes, or their intermediates, apply more widely in real-world ecological systems is an open question that needs empirical evidence, and suggests a research agenda at the interface of evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology.},

abstract = {Widespread occurrence of trace pharmaceutical residues in aquatic environments is of great concerns due to the potential chronic toxicity of certain pharmaceuticals including ibuprofen on aquatic organisms even at environmental levels. In this study, the phytoextraction, phytotransformation and rhizodegradation of ibuprofen associated with Typha angustifolia were investigated in a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland system. The experimental wetland system consisted of a planted bed with Typha angustifolia and an unplanted bed (control) to treat ibuprofen-loaded wastewater ({\~{}}107.2 $\mu$g L-1). Over a period of 342 days, ibuprofen was accumulated in leaf sheath and lamina tissues at a mean concentration of 160.7 ng g-1, indicating the occurrence of the phytoextraction of ibuprofen. Root-uptake ibuprofen was partially transformed to ibuprofen carboxylic acid, 2-hydroxy ibuprofen and 1-hydroxy ibuprofen which were found to be 1374.9, 235.6 and 301.5 ng g-1in the sheath, respectively, while they were 1051.1, 693.6 and 178.7 ng g-1in the lamina. The findings from pyrosequencing analysis of the rhizosphere bacteria suggest that the Dechloromonas sp., the Clostridium sp. (e.g. Clostridium saccharobutylicum), the order Sphingobacteriales, and the Cytophaga sp. in the order Cytophagales were most probably responsible for the rhizodegradation of ibuprofen.},

abstract = {Despite increased interest in the implementation of green walls in urban areas and the recognised benefits of monetary valuation of ecosystem services, no studies have been undertaken to estimate the economic value of biodiversity they provide. The valuation of natural resources allows policy makers to justify resource allocation. Using the Southampton, UK, as a case study, this paper estimates the public's perceived value of green walls to urban biodiversity, in the form of their willingness to pay (WTP). Estimates were derived using a random parameter model that accounted for socio-economic and attitudinal determinants of choice, using choice experiment data. Three green infrastructure policies were tested; two green wall designs (‘living wall' and ‘green fa{\c{c}}ade') and an ‘alternative green policy'; and compared against ‘no green policy'. Results indicated a WTP associated with green infrastructure that increases biodiversity. Attitudinal characteristics such as knowledge of biodiversity and aesthetic opinion were significant, providing an indication of identifiable preferences between green policies and green wall designs. A higher level of utility was associated with the living wall, followed by the green fa{\c{c}}ade. In both cases, the value of the green wall policies exceeds the estimated investment cost; so our results suggest that implementation would provide net economic benefits.},

abstract = {High levels of browsing by mammalian herbivores can negatively affect the survival and growth of seedlings, and consequently revegetation and forest regeneration outcomes. Typical forms of protection (e.g. tree guards and fencing) are costly, particularly when used in large-scale projects, therefore, low-cost alternatives are needed. Based on associational refuge theory, we assessed the revegetation technique ‘cryptic planting', whereby woody seedlings are planted within the foliage of unpalatable plants to deter browsing. We established a trial where 432 six-month-old tubestock of three woody species (Eucalyptus camphora, Melaleuca squarrosa and Leptospermum lanigerum) were cryptically (within the foliage perimeter of unpalatable plants) or non-cryptically planted across three wetland forest sites. The plants were left for four weeks before being scored for browsing damage based on an estimate of biomass removed. To further assess cryptic planting, we surveyed 352 plants of the same three woody species two years after they were planted cryptically or non-cryptically at the same three sites, and surveyed each plant for browsing damage. Overall, cryptic planting reduced browsing damage from 37{\%} to 22{\%}, and from 51{\%} to 23{\%}, in the trial and survey, respectively. E. camphora plants were particularly susceptible to browsing. These results suggest that cryptic planting provides an alternative to costly tree guards and fencing and can be used to reduce browsing on woody seedlings.},

Although forests provide essential ecological services, they have been less well investigated. * We used dendrochronology to compare the tree radial growth rates of four important timber species in replicated, spatially mapped stands that differed in tree composition and diversity within a central European managed forest. * Growth rates differed among species but were largely unaffected by the density of neighbouring trees. * Increasing stand diversity enhanced individual growth rates, after accounting for the effects of tree density and size. These increases were statistically indistinguishable among the four species. In contrast, the effects of stand and neighbourhood species composition on growth rates were non-significant. * Policy implications. Our study of long-established central European forest stands revealed levels of tree diversity can be increased in managed forests, with the potential for modest increases in tree growth rates. These results suggest that in addition to the biodiversity and risk mitigation benefits associated with shifting practices away from monoculture management, increased carbon sequestration and yields in mature forests are likely to be realized. Our results suggest that it is possible to increase forest diversity with little or no costs to production and even with the potential for modest increases in tree growth rates.},

R. Br.], (ii) sorghum sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench × S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf], (iii) cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp], and (iv) sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.). Crops were seeded in monoculture and in three- and four-species mixtures using a replacement design where monoculture seeding rates were divided by the number of species in the intercrop. Crop biomass was sampled at ∼45 and 90 d after planting. When averaged across the nine site-years, biomass at the first and second sampling dates, respectively, of the monoculture treatments ranged from 1040 and 2500 kg ha−1 (cowpea) to 3000 and 9300 kg ha−1 (pearl millet). In general, biomass production of the legume monocultures was lower than the grass monocultures and intercrops at both sampling dates. All intercrops had land equivalent ratios (LERs) greater than one, indicating complementarity, likely a result of resource partitioning. Intercrops, particularly the four-species mixture, exhibited greater stability in yields across environments. The pearl millet-sorghum sudangrass-sunn hemp intercrop had the greatest evenness, suggesting that species selected for annual intercrops should have similar monoculture growth rates to minimize asymmetric competition.},

Morphologically, individual hyphal filaments within all architectural types looked quite similar and clear architectural differences could only be identified when distinct sets of interconnected hyphal filaments were studied. The primary hyphal architectural types observed in the soil were classified as runner hyphae bridges, absorptive hyphal networks, germ tubes, and infection networks produced by spores and root fragments.},

abstract = {The ecological and environmental shortcomings of landscapes dominated by monocultures of crops have led to increased pressure to farm in a more holistic, environmentally sound, socially acceptable manner. The USDA Continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CCRP) is one answer to this shift in philosophy. One program within CCRP, CP33, habitat buffers for upland birds, was designed to provide incentives for substituting herbaceous buffers for crop field margins to promote wildlife habitat. Farmers have been slow to sign up for CP33, possibly out of concern for the borders' impact on insect pest abundance, crop yield and profitability. We examined the impact of three herbaceous border compositions on yield in soybean over 3 years. The border treatments were: (1) a cool-season grass/legume mixture, (2) a warm-season grass/legume mixture, and (3) tall fescue. In addition, the experimental control (soybean border) provided the opportunity to examine the effect of hedgerows on crop yield. We found only a few differences in soybean yield among border treatments and discerned no specific cause-and-effect relationship between buffers and soybean yield, or among distances into the soybean fields from the crop-border interface. We conclude that herbaceous conservation buffers would have little or no impact on soybean yield and should be promoted for their positive environmental benefits. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {For two decades, genetic engineering has made it possible to develop crops and trees designed for yield improvement and simplified culture management. This, combined with field deployment of monocultures over large areas, can result in environmental stress and unwanted potential side effects. The commercial production of genetically modified (GM) crops and the recent development of GM trees raise concerns about their potential impact on the environment, in general, and on the biodiversity of non-target organisms, in particular. Fungi are spread worldwide and play key roles in ecosystems. They have been closely associated with plants since they emerged from the oceans. This review critically examines research monitoring the potential effects of GM crops and GM trees on target and non-target fungi. Parsing public databases for peer-reviewed publications about GM plant impacts on fungi yielded 149 studies, a relatively modest number considering the diversity of crops and ecosystems studied. Analysis of these publications showed that the effects of GM plants expressing herbicide and insect tolerance on fungi are understudied while they dominate the GM area worldwide. Experiments monitoring the impact of GM crops and GM trees with enhanced antifungal activity towards target fungi showed, for the most part, significant decreases in disease severity caused by fungal pathogens. Significant changes, expressed as an increase or decrease in fungal development, abundance, and diversity of non-target fungi, were observed in 18 out of 60 studies and all of them involved GM plants expressing traits that were unexpected to affect fungi. The remaining 42 studies did not identify a significant impact on fungal populations. Therefore, in spite of the fact that GM plants have been commercialized since 1996, no clear generalized trend can be identified and it appears that a case-by-case approach is the safest.},

abstract = {Concerted use of legumes and of functional diversity in grassland forage systems can provide major contributions to the challenges of agricultural systems being productive yet environmental friendly. Acquisition and transformation of nitrogen (N) resources by legumes and grasses were studied in a temperate grassland experiment near Zurich (Switzerland) to investigate mechanisms driving effects of functional diversity in mixed swards and to optimise mixtures for efficient resource use.Grass-legume interactions and N availability were varied by manipulating legume percentage of the sward (0-100{\%}) and N fertiliser application (50, 150 or 450kgofNha-1year-1).15N technology quantified N derived from symbiotic (Nsym) and non-symbiotic (Nnonsym) sources.Generally, acquisition of Nsym by the entire mixture was stimulated by grasses. As a result, strong overyielding of Nsym occurred (e.g. 75 and 114{\%} for year 1 and 2 at N150) and mixtures with only 60{\%} and 37{\%} legumes (year 1 and 2) already attained the same Nsym yield as pure legume stands. Legumes stimulated Nnonsym acquisition by the entire mixture, largely via increased uptake by the grass component. Thus, overyielding of Nnonsym of 31{\%} occurred in year 1 (N150).Mutual grass-legume interactions stimulated acquisition of Nsym, acquisition of Nnonsym and efficient transformation of N into biomass compared to either monocultures. These effects of functional diversity can substantially contribute to productive and resource efficient agricultural grassland systems and were maximised in mixtures with 40-60{\%} legumes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The use of native plants on green roofs has attracted considerable attention in recent years. With this comes the implicit assumptions that native plants are better adapted, provide greater environmental benefit, and are more aesthetically pleasing than non-native plants. We examined papers published in scholarly journals and papers presented at the annual North American green roof conference to identify who is promoting the use of native plants on green roofs, their rationale for doing so, and the scientific evidence to support the assertion that natives are better adapted. Architects, landscape architects, and biologists were the most likely to promote native plants and engineers were the least likely. Many of the reasons for using native plants on green roofs originate from ground-level landscaping and have simply been transplanted to the roof, without regard for the fact that the rooftop is a fundamentally different environment than the ground. Nearly half of all pro-native papers used the term " native" without definition. This review highlights the need for greater rigor and transparency when promoting the use of native plants and further demonstrates how misconceptions can result in sub-optimal green roof design and performance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {1. Many studies document high levels of functional redundancy in ecosystems, suggesting that species extinctions will not be detrimental to ecosystem functions and services. However, apparently redundant taxa may prove critical for sustaining ecosystem functions and services in the context of environmental perturbations. 2. Dung beetles (Coleoptera:Scarabaeidae) provide a valuable ecosystem service in temperate agro-ecosystems by increasing rates of dung decomposition and nutrient cycling. However, there is concern that these services may be negatively affected by changes in species richness and composition due to changes in pasture management and negative effects of anthelmintics used to control livestock parasites. 3. We used a mesocosm experiment to investigate the functional importance of dung beetle species richness in a system perturbed by the anthelmintic, ivermectin. We varied dung beetle species richness within three functional groups in factorial combination with ivermectin treat- ment. 4. In the short term (1–4 weeks), multi-species dung beetle assemblages achieved higher decomposition rates than monocultures, but only in ivermectin-treated dung. Varying species- specific sensitivities to ivermectin meant that species-rich assemblages sustained ecosystem functioning in the context of this anthropogenic perturbation. 5. Over the longer term (36 weeks), there was a significant, positive effect of species richness on dung decomposition in both ivermectin-treated and untreated dung, underlining the func- tional importance of maintaining a species-rich dung processing community even in the absence of perturbations to the system. 6. Synthesis and applications. The interacting effects of dung beetle species richness and ivermectin highlight the importance of maintaining diverse assemblages in the face of anthro- pogenic perturbations and suggest that apparent functional redundancy of species in agro- ecosystems should be interpreted cautiously. Furthermore, different farm management practices (e.g. pesticide use and fragmentation of habitats) may have consequences for ecosys- tem functions and services that exceed the effects of each when considered in isolation.},

However, there is limited knowledge on the effect of green roof characteristics (e.g. substrate depth and roof age, size and height), especially in northern climates, on plant species composition of the roofs, even though roof performance is mediated through the plants. We hypothesized that substrate depth and roof age, size and height shape the vegetation on green roofs. We inventoried vegetation on 51 green roofs in the metropolitan area of Helsinki in 2011 and found 230 plant species, of which seven are red-listed. We showed that substrate depth and roof age were predominant in structuring plant communities on green roofs. Thin substrates and young roofs maintained sedum and moss species, while thick substrates and older green roofs supported meadow plants. Roof size and height had variable effects on the vegetation. Our results provide knowledge on the dependence of plant species on roof parameters, which is useful in the planning for particular vegetation on roofs taking into account, e.g. load capacity and substrate depth, the wanted functional properties of the roof, and maintenance.},

- observational study based in northern climates (Finland)
- surveyed various roof characteristics (e.g. roof age, size, height, cover) in 51 green roofs

FINDINGS:
- two distinct green roof types:

abstract = {Urban ecosystems pose different environmental constraints on plant and animal communities than natural ecosystems, and this in turn might affect ecological interactions. We investigated plant-pollinator interactions in urban vegetation communities in the context of local community structure and two landscape metrics describing the surrounding urban matrix. We recorded plant species diversity, floral density, pollinator species and floral visits at 89 flowering patches within the urban matrix, and used Trifolium pratense as a focal plant species. We correlated visits by all species, by bees, by bees when excluding the main visitor Bombus pascuorum, and by the main visitor alone T. pratense with the landscape metrics " green area", representing the total extent of vegetated areas, and " edge density of green areas", representing the degree of habitat fragmentation, at scales from 20 to 200. m. Extent of green area was positively correlated with visits by all species, by bees, and by Bombus pascuorum, but negatively with bees excluding the main visitor. The correlation increased with scale for all four variables, and the strongest correlations were found for B. pascuorum. The direction of correlation between edge density and the visitation variables was similar as for green area, but showed considerable variation at scales below 100. m radius. Visits by all bees and all visitors to T. pratense were negatively affected by flowering plant species diversity. There was a positive interaction between extent of green area and plant diversity on bee visitation, and a negative interaction between the extent of green area and heterospecific flowers for bees (excluding B. pascuorum). Increasing floral abundance and plant diversity reduced pollinator visitation to T. pratense, suggesting competitive effects through both quantity and diversity of resources. Competition for flower visitors was mainly from Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, both of which frequently co-occurred with T. pratense. We conclude that T. pratense competes for pollinators with other co-occurring plants, but that the nature of the surrounding urban matrix mediates interactions among plant species for pollinator services at different scales, particularly with respect to the proportion of green areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

abstract = {High species diversity often enhances ecosystem function; however, the effects of diversity have not been commonly explored in the context of natural ecosystem variation. In intermountain grassland, it has been reported that Pinusponderosa canopies and litter reduces the diversity of native species and increases the abundance of Bromus tectorum, an invasive species. Thus this is a realistic system for exploring context-dependency in the effects of diversity on ecosystem function. We established native plant assemblages that varied in species richness and crossed each species richness level with Pinus litter addition. All plots were experimentally invaded with B. tectorum, allowing us to explore context-dependency in the effects of native diversity on community productivity and resistance to exotic invasion. Native polycultures had higher native plant cover, a surrogate for productivity, and stronger resistance to Bromus invasion relative to monocultures. We found that species-independent complementarity effect was the main contributor to the diversity effect on native plant cover, which increased as species richness in polycultures increased. Species-dependent complementarity/selection effects on native cover were negligible, and neither complementarity nor selection effects on native resistance to invasion varied with native richness. Pinus litter had no direct effect on native cover or Bromus performance, but decreased the effects of high native diversity on native cover and increased the effects of high native diversity on native resistance to Bromus. Thus we found some evidence for context-dependency and that low species richness under Pinus canopies might facilitate Bromus invasion. Importantly, the diversity-dependent increase in native plant cover was not correlated with diversity-dependent increases in resistance to invasion among plots, suggesting different mechanisms for how diversity enhances productivity versus resistance.},

abstract = {he installation of green roofs, defined here as rooftops with a shallow soil cover and extensive vegetation, has been proposed as a possible measure to mitigate the loss of green space caused by the steady growth of cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition ({\ss} diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species},

abstract = {Taxa co-occurring in communities often represent a nonrandom sample, in phenotypic or phylogenetic terms, of the regional species pool. While heuristic arguments have identified processes that create community phylogenetic patterns, further progress hinges on a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between underlying ecological and evolutionary processes. We created a simulation framework to model trait evolution, assemble communities (via competition, habitat filtering, or neutral assembly), and test the phylogenetic pattern of the resulting communities. We found that phylogenetic community structure is greatest when traits are highly conserved and when multiple traits influence species membership in communities. Habitat filtering produces stronger phylogenetic structure when taxa with derived (as opposed to ancestral) traits are favored in the community. Nearest-relative tests have greater power to detect patterns due to competition, while total community relatedness tests perform better with habitat filtering. The size of the local community relative to the regional pool strongly influences statistical power; in general, power increases with larger pool sizes for communities created by filtering but decreases for communities created by competition. Our results deepen our understanding of processes that contribute to phylogenetic community structure and provide guidance for the design and interpretation of empirical research.},

abstract = {Positive species richness–productivity rela- tionships are common in biodiversity experiments, but how resource availability modifies biodiversity effects in grass–legume mixtures composed of highly productive spe- cies is yet to be explicitly tested. We addressed this ques- tion by choosing two grasses (Arrhenatherum elatius and Dactylis glomerata) and two legumes (Medicago × varia and Onobrychis viciifolia) which are highly productive in monocultures and dominant in mixtures (the Jena Experi- ment). We established monocultures, all possible two- and three-species mixtures, and the four-species mixture under three different resource supply conditions (control, fertili- zation, and shading). Compared to the control, community biomass production decreased under shading (−56 {\%}) and increased under fertilization (+12 {\%}). Net diversity effects (i.e., mixture minus mean monoculture biomass) were positive in the control and under shading (on average +15 and +72 {\%}, respectively) and negative under fertilization (−10 {\%}). Positive complementarity effects in the control suggested resource partitioning and facilitation of growth through symbiotic N2 fixation by legumes. Positive com- plementarity effects under shading indicated that resource partitioning is also possible when growth is carbon-limited. Negative complementarity effects under fertilization sug- gested that external nutrient supply depressed facilitative grass–legume interactions due to increased competition for light. Selection effects, which quantify the dominance of species with particularly high monoculture biomasses in the mixture, were generally small compared to complemen- tarity effects, and indicated that these species had compara- ble competitive strengths in the mixture. Our study shows that resource availability has a strong impact on the occur- rence of positive diversity effects among tall and highly productive grass and legume species.},

This may help to derive implications for urban planning in order to promote and maintain high diversity and ecosystem function in an increasing urbanized environment. The structure of wintering bird communities of 36 Vienna city parks – surveyed once a month in January 2009, December 2009, December 2012, and January 2013 – was described by species richness and the functional diversity measurements FRic (functional richness), FEve (functional evenness), and FDiv (functional divergence). Environmental filtering was quantified by park size, canopy heterogeneity within the park, and the proportion of sealed area surrounding each park. Species richness, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing park size. Sealed area had a strong negative effect on species richness and FDiv. Canopy heterogeneity played a minor role in explaining variance in FDiv data. FEve did not respond to any of these park parameters. Our results suggest a loss of species richness and functional diversity, hence most likely indicate a decline in ecosystem function, with decreasing park size and increasing sealed area of the surrounding urban landscape matrix.},

abstract = {Previous research has found that plant diversity declines more quickly in exotic than native grassland plots, which offers a model system for testing whether diversity decline is associated with specific plant traits. In a common garden experiment in the Southern Great Plains in central Texas, USA, we studied monocultures and 9-species mixtures of either all exotic or all native grassland species. A total of 36 native and exotic species were paired by phylogeny and functional group. We used community-level measures (relative abundance in mixture) and whole-plant (height, aboveground biomass, and light capture) and leaf-level traits (area, specific leaf area, and C:N ratio) to determine whether trait differences explained native-exotic differences in functional group diversity. Increases in species' relative abundance in mixture were correlated with high biomass, height, and light capture in both native and exotic communities. However, increasing exotic species were all C4 grasses, whereas, increasing native species included forb, C3 grass and C4 grass species. Exotic C4 grasses had traits associated with relatively high resource capture: greater leaf area, specific leaf area, height, biomass, and light capture, but similar leaf C:N ratios compared to native C4 grasses. Leaf C:N was consistently higher for native than exotic C3 species, implying that resource use efficiency was greater in natives than exotics. Our results suggest that functional diversity will differ between grasslands restored to native assemblages and those dominated by novel collections of exotic species, and that simple plant traits can help to explain diversity decline.},

abstract = {1. Root, stem and leaf traits are thought to be functionally coordinated to maximize the efficiency of acquiring and using limited resources. However, evidence is mixed for consistent whole-plant trait coordination among woody plants, and we lack a clear understanding of the adaptive value of root traits along soil resource gradients. If fine roots are the below-ground analogue to leaves, then low specific root length (SRL) and high tissue density should be common on infertile soil. Here, we test the prediction that root, stem and leaf traits and relative growth rate respond in unison with soil fertility gradients. 2. We measured fine root, stem and leaf traits and relative growth rate on individual seedlings of 66 tree species grown in controlled conditions. Our objectives were (i) to determine whether multiple root traits align with growth rate, leaf and stem traits and with each other and (ii) to quantify the relationships between community-weighted mean root traits and two strong soil fertility gradients that differed in spatial extent and community composition. 3. At the species level, fast growth rates were associated with low root and stem tissue density and high specific leaf area. SRL and root diameter were not clearly related to growth rate and loaded on a separate principal component from the plant economic spectrum. 4. At the community level, growth rate was positively related to soil fertility, and root tissue density (RTD) and branching were negatively related to soil fertility.

Root, stem and leaf tissue traits of tree seedlings are coordinated and influence fitness along soil fertility gradients. RTD responds in unison with above-ground traits to soil fertility gradi- ents; however, root traits are multidimensional because SRL is orthogonal to the plant economic spectrum. In contrast to leaves, trees are not constrained in the way they construct fine roots: plants can construct high or low SRL roots of any tissue density. High RTD is the most consistent below- ground trait that reflects adaptation to infertile soil.

abstract = {Wetlands provide critical habitat for a diverse group of organisms and provide important ecosystem services. Despite this, most natural wetlands have been lost to anthropogenic activities, and as a result, wetland construction is common mitigation practice. Therefore, examination of constructed wetland viability in replacing the function of lost wetlands is vital. Our primary objectives were to compare amphibian communities of shallow and deep constructed wetlands to natural wetlands and to identify which wetland characteristics affect species composition. All wetlands were hydrologically isolated and fishless; natural wetlands had an ephemeral hydrology, and constructed wetland hydrology varied from ephemeral to permanent. Overall, constructed wetlands did not sufficiently replicate natural wetlands with respect to the amphibian community. However, two of our constructed wetlands had a drying period and exhibited communities more similar to natural wetlands. Hydroperiod and canopy closure were indicators of amphibian community composition. Many species observed in natural wetlands were rare in shallow constructed and absent in deep constructed wetlands. Additionally, dominant predator species (primarily Lithobates catesbeianus, Lithobates clamitans, and Notophthalmus viridescens) associated with permanent water were more abundant in constructed wetlands. Water depth, pH, and emergent vegetation were lower in natural wetlands. These data influenced land managers to revise construction methods and to renovate deep constructed wetlands by creating gradual slopes, decreasing maximum depth to 20 cm or less, maintaining canopy cover, and decreasing soil compaction to attempt replication of natural wetland hydrology.},

abstract = {The semiochemical diversity hypothesis (SDH) states that interference with host-selection from non-host volatiles (NHV) is an important mechanism for associational resistance. Inhibition of bark beetle attraction to point sources by non-host volatiles (NHV) is well established and might be a signal serving in host-selection also at the habitat scale. In forests dominated by Norway spruce in middle and northern Europe (N Slovakia 2006 {\&} 2007, SE Sweden 2007), we applied a blend of NHV and verbenone, released from dispensers fixed at 2 and 6 m height at forest edges with high Ips typographus populations. In Slovakia, three different doses (0.2–0.7 dispensers/m forest edge) were tested in 20-tree zones of spruce stand edges. The Swedish experiments used only the middle dose. In Slovakia, there was high tree mortality but dispensers with the anti-attractants reduced killed trees in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction in tree killing ranged from 35 to 76{\%} compared to untreated zones. Regression analysis of relative tree kill on log dispenser density was highly significant ( = 0.34, corresponding effect size d≈ 0.98). In Sweden, with lower beetle populations, most attacks (99{\%}) were found outside the experimental areas, with high attack rates (15 trees/ha) in a range of 15–30 m from treated groups, indicating an active inhibitory radius exceeding the previous estimates. The SDH as a functional aspect of biodiversity was tested by converting spruce monocultures into an artificial semiochemically mixed forests. The use of NHV provides the only non-insecticidal method of direct protection of conifer forests. The demonstrated principle of protection is still too expensive for area-wide use, but viable for high-value areas (nature reserves). Further development of push–pull strategies or area-wide applications may prove more cost efficient. In the long-term, the only sustainable approach is a forest landscape of mixed habitats.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity, the expression of traits dependent on an individual's environment, should increase the range of communities in which a plant can establish, potentially influencing community assembly. Plasticity may be induced by either the mean or variance in conditions; however, plant responses to variance in the environment remain largely unquantified. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in northeastern Ohio using two congeneric pairs of perennial species in a design that crossed two soil heterogeneity and two light heterogeneity treat- ments. Nested within the soil heterogeneity treatment were patches of congener and conspecific origin, which tests the effects of possible plant-soil feedbacks on trait expression. We used plant biomass to measure performance and root:shoot ratio and specific leaf area (SLA) to measure resource acquisition and allocation. Plant biomass responded to the origin of the soil, consistent with the literature demonstrating that plant- soil feedbacks influence plant performance. Soil and light heterogeneity interacted to significantly affect resource acquisition traits (i.e., SLA) demonstrating that plants integrated both above- and belowground resource variance. All four species showed light- dependent, non-additive effects of soil mixture, though these effects were only marginally significant (P$\backslash$0.10). This is important in the context of community assembly because studies find the variance in environmental drivers to be as, or more, important than the means in determining community structure. This study provides some of the first evidence that plant trait expression responds to the variance of environmental drivers, including those driven by plant-soil feedbacks, as well as the means.},

abstract = {While it is well-established that the spatial distribution of soil nutrients (soil heterogeneity) influences the competitive ability and survival of individual plants, as well as the productivity of plant communities, there is a paucity of data on how soil heterogeneity and global change drivers interact to affect plant performance and ecosystem functioning. To evaluate the effects of elevated CO(2), soil heterogeneity and diversity (species richness and composition) on productivity, patterns of biomass allocation and root foraging precision, we conducted an experiment with grassland assemblages formed by monocultures, two- and three-species mixtures of Lolium perenne, Plantago lanceolata and Holcus lanatus. The experiment lasted for 90 days, and was conducted on microcosms built out of PVC pipe (length 38 cm, internal diameter 10 cm). When nutrients were heterogeneously supplied (in discrete patches), assemblages exhibited precise root foraging patterns, and had higher total, above- and belowground biomass. Greater aboveground biomass was observed under elevated CO(2). Species composition affected the below:aboveground biomass ratio and interacted with nutrient heterogeneity to determine belowground and total biomass. Species richness had no significant effects, and did not interact with either CO(2) or nutrient heterogeneity. Under elevated CO(2) conditions, the two- and three-species mixtures showed a clear trend towards underyielding. Our results show that differences among composition levels were dependent on soil heterogeneity, highlighting its potential role in modulating diversity-productivity relationships.},

abstract = {The expansion of the agricultural frontier by the clearing of remnant forests has led to human-dominated landscape mosaics. Previous studies have evaluated the effect of these landscape mosaics on arthropod diversity at local spatial scales in temperate and tropical regions, but little is known about fragmentation effects in crop systems, such as the complex tropical traditional crop systems that maintain a high diversity of weeds and arthropods in low-Andean regions. To understand the factors that influence patterns of diversity in human-dominated landscapes, we investigate the effect of land use types on plant and arthropod diversity in traditionally managed cornfields, via surveys of plants and arthropods in twelve traditional cornfields in the Colombian Andes. We estimated alpha and beta diversity to analyze changes in diversity related to land uses within a radius of 100 m to 1 km around each cornfield. We observed that forests influenced alpha diversity of plants, but not of arthropods. Agricultural lands had a positive relationship with plants and herbivores, but a negative relationship with predators. Pastures positively influenced the diversity of plants and arthropods. In addition, forest cover seemed to influence changes in plant species composition and species turnover of herbivore communities among cornfields. The dominant plant species varied among fields, resulting in high differentiation of plant communities. Predator communities also exhibited high turnover among cornfields, but differences in composition arose mainly among rare species. The crop system evaluated in this study represents a widespread situation in the tropics, therefore, our results can be of broad significance. Our findings suggest that traditional agriculture may not homogenize biological communities, but instead could maintain the regional pool of species through high beta diversity.},

One hypothesis about competition{\~{O}}s contribution to community assembly is that more closely related species are less likely to coexist. Though empirical evidence for this hypothesis is mixed, it remains a common assumption in certain phylogenetic approaches for inferring the effects of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion. Here, we relate modern coexistence theory to phylogenetic community assembly approaches to refine expectations for how species relatedness influences the outcome of competition. We argue that two types of species differences determine competitive exclusion with opposing effects on relatedness patterns. Importantly, this means that competition can sometimes eliminate more different and less related taxa, even when the traits underlying the relevant species differences are phylogenetically conserved. Our argument leads to a reinterpretation of the assembly processes inferred from community phylogenetic structure.},

The complementary roles of comparative studies and optimality models are stressed throughout. The first section of this paper reviews 23 ecological patterns in leaf form, physiology and arrangement which have heen uncovered hy comparative studies. Three general sets of energetic trade-offs, involving the economics of gas exchange, support, and hiotic interactions, appear likely to influence the evolution of leaves and underlie these trends. The first of these trade-offs is illustrated with an analysis of the adaptive significance of leaf size, in both terrestrial and aquatic plants. The resulting predictions are compared with the actual trends observed, and the relative strengths and limitations of the approach are discussed},

Functional traits are receiving increasing attention as the main ecological attributes by which different organisms and biological communities influence ecosystem services through their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here we synthesize concepts and empirical evidence on linkages between functional traits and ecosystem services across different trophic levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed considered plants and soil invertebrates, but quantitative trait–service associations have been documented for a range of organisms and ecosystems, illustrating the wide applicability of the trait approach. Within each trophic level, specific processes are affected by a combination of traits while particular key traits are simultaneously involved in the control of multiple processes. These multiple associations between traits and ecosystem processes can help to identify predictable trait–service clusters that depend on several trophic levels, such as clusters of traits of plants and soil organisms that underlie nutrient cycling, herbivory, and fodder and fibre production. We propose that the assessment of trait–service clusters will represent a crucial step in ecosystem service monitoring and in balancing the delivery of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, services in ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Recent empirical studies have found evidence of increased biomass production ('overyielding') in species mixtures relative to monoculture, but the interpretation of these results remains controversial, in part, because of the lack of a theoretical expectation. Here, we examined the expected frequency and stability of overyielding species mixtures using Lotka-Volterra models of species dynamics in two- and four-species systems in conjunction with community, population, and specific rate of biomass production (SRP) definitions of overyielding. Overyielding plant mixtures represented {\textgreater} 55{\%} of potential species assemblages under community definitions and approximately 100{\%} of species were either overyielding or underyielding under the population definition. Our species simulations approached their equilibria in 1-2 yr, supporting the relevancy of an equilibrial analysis. The range of parameter space that we explored produced realistic values of plot biomass, supporting their biological relevance. We show that overyielding is expected to be common under community definitions and population definitions. Overyielding, under community or population definitions, does not imply an actual increase in the specific rate of biomass production. In addition, assemblages of overyielding and underyielding species under all three definitions can be stable over time with underyielding species persisting in the presence of overyielding species.},

A critical step in that challenge is to understand how changing environmental conditions influence processes across levels of ecological organization. While direct scaling from individual to ecosystem dynamics can lead to robust and mechanistic predictions, new approaches are needed to appropriately translate questions through the community level. Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this scaling through community processes, but predicting how such changes may influence ecosystem function is notoriously difficult. We suggest that community-level dynamics can be incorporated into scaling predictions using a trait-based response-effect framework that differentiates the community response to environmental change (predicted by response traits) and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species' response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of environmental change on function. We then detail several key research directions needed to better scale the effects of environmental change through the community level. These include (1) effect and response trait characterization, (2) linkages between response-and-effect traits, (3) the importance of species interactions on trait expression, and (4) incorporation of feedbacks across multiple temporal scales. Increasing rates of extinction and invasion that are modifying communities worldwide make such a research agenda imperative. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Declines in species diversity resulting from anthropogenic alterations of the environment heighten the need to develop management strategies that conserve species and ecosystem services. This study examined how native plant species and their diversity influence the abundance and richness of beneficial arthropods, a functionally important group that provides ecosystem services such as pollination and natural pest suppression. Beneficial arthropods were sampled in replicated study plots containing native perennials planted in one-, two-, and seven-species mixtures. We found plant diversity had a positive impact on arthropod richness but not on arthropod abundance. An analysis of arthropod community composition revealed that each flower species attracted a different assemblage of beneficial arthropods. In addition, the full seven-species mixture also attracted a distinct arthropod community compared to single-species monocultures. Using a multivariate approach, we determined whether arthropod assemblages in two- and seven-species plots were additive and could be predicted based on assemblages from their component single-species plots. On average, assemblages in diverse plots were nonadditive when compared to assemblages predicted using single-species plots. Arthropod assemblages in two-species plots most closely resembled those of only one of the flower species in the mixture. However, the arthropod assemblages in seven-species plots, although statistically deviating from the expectation of an additive model, more closely resembled predicted communities compared to the assemblages found in two-species plots, suggesting that variability in arthropod community composition decreased as planting diversity increased. Our study demonstrates that careful selection of plants in managed landscapes can augment beneficial arthropod richness and support a more predictable arthropod community, suggesting that planning and design efforts could shape arthropod assemblages in natural as well as managed landscapes to meet targeted conservation or management goals.},

abstract = {The ability to explain why multispecies assemblages produce greater biomass compared to mono-cultures, has been a central goal in the quest to understand biodiversity effects on ecosystem func-tion. Species contributions to ecosystem function can be driven by two processes: niche complementarity and a selection effect that is influenced by fitness (competitive) differences, and both can be approximated with measures of species' traits. It has been hypothesised that fitness differences are associated with few, singular traits while complementarity requires multidimen-sional trait measures. Here, using experimental data from plant assemblages, I show that the selec-tion effect was strongest when trait dissimilarity was low, while complementarity was greatest with high trait dissimilarity. Selection effects were best explained by a single trait, plant height. Complementarity was correlated with dissimilarity across multiple traits, representing above and below ground processes. By identifying the relevant traits linked to ecosystem function, we obtain the ability to predict combinations of species that will maximise ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Tree species diversity has been reported to increase forest ecosystem above-ground biomass and productivity, but little is known about below-ground biomass and production in diverse mixed forests compared to single-species forests. For testing whether species richness increases below-ground biomass and production and thus complementarity between forest tree species in young stands, we determined fine root biomass and production of trees and ground vegetation in two experimental plantations representing gradients in tree species richness. Additionally, we measured tree fine root length and determined species composition from fine root biomass samples with the near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy method. We did not observe higher biomass or production in mixed stands compared to monocultures. Neither did we observe any differences in tree root length or fine root turnover. One reason for this could be that these stands were still young, and canopy closure had not always taken place, i.e. a situation where above- or below-ground competition did not yet exist. Another reason could be that the rooting traits of the tree species did not differ sufficiently to support niche differentiation. Our results suggested that functional group identity (i.e. conifers vs. broadleaved species) can be more important for below-ground biomass and production than the species richness itself, as conifers seemed to be more competitive in colonising the soil volume, compared to broadleaved species.},

abstract = {The objective was to analyse how differences in the initial proportions of tree species and site fertility affect carbon sequestration in living biomass and soil. We used the individual-based simulation model EFIMOD, which is able to simulate spatially explicit competition between trees for light and nutrients. Simulations were carried out for three site types with distinct initial stocks of soil nutrients. For each site, the 100-years undisturbed dynamics of monocultures and mixtures of three tree species (Betula pendula Roth, Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) was predicted. Changes in the proportions of competing tree species were dependent on the fertility of the site: on poor sites, pine was the most competent species, while on rich sites, spruce increased its proportion during stand succession. Net primary production (NPP) and soil respiration were the highest in stands of two coniferous species and in stands with a high initial proportion of pine. Mixed stands were more productive than monocultures; the highest overyielding was observed with mixtures of two coniferous species. Simulated NPP and carbon stocks in all pools increased from poor to rich sites. The highest carbon stocks in standing biomass were observed for mixtures of conifer species and three-species mixtures; the greatest accumulation of forest floor occurred in stands with high proportions of pine. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract = {The native perennial Urtica dioica and the invasive alien annual Impatiens glandulifera often co-occur in European riparian herb communities. This paper aims to answer two questions: i) can l. glandulifera outcompete U. dioica: and ii) how does hydrology influence competition? Two mesocosm experiments assessed growth of, and competition between, the two species when subjected firstly to three water-table regimes and secondly to five flood treatments. Results indicated that both species preferred lower water-tables and that floods early in spring adversely affected their growth. Deposition of sediment during flooding appeared to have little effect. Presence of U. dioica appeared to inhibit germination and, in flooded treatments. growth of l. glandulifera. However, during the water-table experiment, U. dioica plants grown in mixed cultures with l. glandulifera showed significantly reduced growth at the end of season compared to those grown in monocultures. This indicates that. once established. l. glandulifera can have a negative effect on U. dioica. These results point to a rare case of an annual species, l. glandulifera, out-competing a perennial, U. dioica. They also have implications for the biodiversity and management of riparian habitats.},

abstract = {Monocultures typical of intensive agriculture offer ideal conditions to specialized herbivores while depriving their natural enemies of habitat and nutritional resources. The resulting release of herbivores from both bottom-up and top-down control causes pest outbreaks in economically important crops. Boosting locally occurring natural enemy populations through species-specific habitat management to restore natural herbivore control has been much advocated but remains rarely tested in the field. Here, we investigated whether adding specifically selected flowering plants to monocultures increases parasitation rates of herbivores and crop yield. We performed replicated field experiments in 2. years and found that adding cornflowers (Centaurea cyanus) into cabbage (Brassica oleracea) fields significantly increased larval and egg parasitation and egg predation of the herbivore, reduced herbivory rates, and increased crop biomass in at least 1. year. These findings show that addition of a single, well-chosen flowering plant species can significantly increase natural top-down pest control in monocultures but success is variable. This is relevant on two applied levels. First, well chosen companion plants may partially substitute pesticides in agriculture if the approach is optimized, reducing negative effects such as unspecific killing of non-target organisms, residues in food, contamination of soils and water-bodies and increasing pesticide resistances. Our results suggest that, from an agro-economical point of view, egg parasitoids or predators may be the best targets for habitat management because strong natural selection acts on larval parasitoids to keep their hosts alive for their own development. Second, the addition of non-crop vegetation to monocultures benefits biodiversity conservation directly through resource diversification and indirectly through the reduction of pesticide application that increased natural control makes possible. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Putative future increase in atmospheric CO2 is expected to adversely affect herbivore growth due to decrease in contents of key nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus (P) relative to carbon in primary producers including plant and algal species. However, as many herbivores are polyphagous and as the response of primary producers to elevated CO2 is highly species-specific, effects of elevated CO2 on herbivore growth may differ between feeding conditions with monospecific and multiproducer diets. To examine this possibility, we performed CO2 manipulation experiments under a P-limited condition with a planktonic herbivore, Daphnia, and three algal species, Scenedesmus obliquus (green algae), Cyclotella sp. (diatoms) and Synechococcus sp. (cyanobacteria). Semibatch cultures with single algal species (monocultures) and multiple algal species (mixed cultures) were grown at ambient (360 ppm) and high CO2 levels (2000 ppm) that were within the natural range in lakes. Both in the mono-and mixed cultures, algal steady state abundance increased but algal P:C and N:C ratios decreased when they were grown at high CO2. As expected, Daphnia fed monospecific algae cultured at high CO2 had decreased growth rates despite increased algal abundance. However, when fed mixed algae cultured at high CO2, especially consisting of diatoms and cyanobacteria or the three algal species, Daphnia maintained high growth rates despite lowered P and N contents relative to C in the algal diets. These results imply that algal diets composed of multiple species can mitigate the adverse effects of elevated CO2 on herbivore performance, although the magnitude of this mitigation depends on the composition of algal species involved in the diets.},

Publication bias refers to phenomena arising from bias in submitting, reviewing, accepting and publishing scientific results. Direct and indirect methods for investigating publication bias are now readily available, but indirect methods are generally open to alternative interpretations. Publication bias distorts attempts to review a scientific field quantitatively if the likelihood of locating completed studies depends on the strength or direction of the findings of quantitative studies. It is the responsibility of researchers, reviewers and editors to address issues of bias to ensure the existence of an unbiased literature.},
annote = {Publication bias (PB)
- published lit does not reflect finished research projects in a particular subject area
- two aspects of PB: (1) choice of research topics,
(2) non-random sample sizes
- MA summarizes body of lit using effect sizes
- PB occurs whenever stregnth or direction of results of published + unpublished studies differ
- no bias if published articles are random sample of the original source pool of research 

Three ways in which PB occur: 
- submission bias: researchers don't want to submit non-significant results
- editorial bias: editors do not wish to publish non-significant results
- reviewer bias: bias based on author prestige, nationality or gender

Dissemination bias:
- biased electronic seraches when strength of findings of located and unnlocated publications differs 
- media favors positive results
- conference talks favor positive results

Fail-safe number of unpublished studies
- Rosenthal's fail-safe number
- estimates the numenr of unpublished studies required to eliminate a significant overall effect size
- huge emphasis on statistical significance

Funnel plots
- case 1: random samples - a funnel emerges 
- case 2: publication bias - large skew towards positive effects
- but skewed funel plot may be caused by other factors than PB

Effect size and sample size
- if PB toward significant results, true effect size is small, then effect is expected to weaken as sample size increases
- Begg and Mazumdar proposed a distribution-free rank correlation test

abstract = {In soft-bottom sediments, consumers may influence ecosystem function more via engineering that alters abiotic resources than through trophic influences. Understanding the influence of bioturbation on physical, chemical, and biological processes of the water-sediment interface requires investigating top-down (consumer) and bottom-up (resource) forces. The objective of the present study was to determine how consumer bioturbation mode and sediment properties interact to dictate the hydrologie function of experimental filtration systems clogged by the deposition of fine sediments. Three fine-grained sediments characterized by different organic matter (OM) and pollu- tant content were used to assess the influence of resource type: sediment of urban origin highly loaded with OM and pollutants, river sediments rich in OM, and river sediments poor in OM content. The effects of consumer bioturbation (chironomid larvae vs. tubificid worms) on sediment reworking, changes in hydraulic head and hydraulic conductivity, and water fluxes through the water-sediment interface were measured. Invertebrate influences in reducing the clogging process depended not only on the mode of bioturbation (construction of biogenic structures, burrowing and feeding activities, etc.) but also on the interaction between the bioturbation process and the sediments of the clogging layer. We present a conceptual model that highlights the importance of sediment influences on bioturbation and argues for the integration of bottom-up influence on consumer engineering activities.},

abstract = {AimsThe potential for mixtures of plant species to produce more biomass than every one of their constituent species in monoculture is still controversially discussed in the literature. Here we tested how this so-called transgressive overyielding is affected by variation between and within species in monoculture yields in biodiversity experiments. MethodsWe use basic statistical principles to calculate expected maximum monoculture yield in a species pool used for a biodiversity experiment. Using a real example we show how between- and within-species variance components in monoculture yields can be obtained. Combining the two components we estimate the importance of sampling bias in transgressive overyielding analysis. Important FindingsThe net biodiversity effect (difference between mixture and average monoculture yield) needed to achieve transgressive overyielding increases with the number of species in a mixture and with the variation between constituent species in monoculture yields. If there is no significant variation between species, transgressive overyielding should not be calculated using the best monoculture, because in this case the difference between this species and the other species could exclusively reflect a sampling bias. The sampling bias decreases with increasing variation between species. Tests for transgressive overyielding require replicated species' monocultures. However, it can be doubted whether such an emphasis on monocultures in biodiversity experiments is justified if an analysis of transgressive overyielding is not the major goal.},

abstract = {The exponential increase in population has fueled a significant demographic shift: 60{\%} of the Earth's population will live in urban areas by 2030. While this population growth is significant in its magnitude, the ecological footprint of natural resource consumption and use required to sustain urban populations is even greater. The land use and cover changes accompanying urbanization (increasing human habitation coupled with resource consumption and extensive landscape modification) impacts natural ecosystems at multiple spatial scales. Because they generally occupy lower landscape positions and are linked to other ecosystems through hydrologic connec-tions, the cascading effects of habitat alteration on watershed hydrology and nutrient cycling are particularly detrimental to wetland ecosystems. I reviewed literature relevant to these effects of urbanization on the structure and function of forested wetlands. Hydrologic changes caused by habitat fragmentation generally reduce species richness and abundance of plants, macroinvertebrates, amphibians, and birds with greater numbers of invasives and exotics. Reduction in soil saturation and lowered water tables result in greater nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in urban wetlands with higher probability of NO − 3 export from the watershed. Depressional forested wetlands in urban areas can function as important sinks for sediments, nutrients, and metals. As urban ecosystems become the predominant human condition, there is a critical need for data specific to urban forested wetlands in order to better understand the role of these ecosystems on the landscape.},

abstract = {Increased biodiversity may improve ecosystem services, including herbage yield. A mixture experiment was carried out at five sites in Northern Europe and one in Canada to investigate whether mixtures of grasses and legumes would give higher herbage yield than monocultures. Resistance of the mixtures to weed invasion and nutritive value of the herbage were also investigated. The experimental layout followed a simplex design, where four species differing in specific functional traits, timothy (Phleum pratense L.), smooth meadow grass (Poa pratensis L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.), were grown in monocultures and eleven different mixtures with systematically varying proportions of the four species. Positive diversity effects (DE) were observed, leading to greater herbage dry-matter (DM) yield in mixtures than expected from species sown in monocultures. For centroid mixtures, the DE generated on average an additional 32, 25 and 21{\%} of the DM yield than would be expected from the monocultures in the first, second and third year respectively. On average, the mixtures were 9, 15 and 7{\%} more productive than the most productive monoculture (transgressive overyielding) in the first, second and third year respectively. These benefits persisted over the three harvest years of the experiment and were consistent among most sites. This positive effect was not accompanied by a reduction in herbage digestibility and crude protein concentration that is usually observed with increased DM yield. Mixtures also reduced the invasion of weeds to {\textless}5{\%} of herbage yield compared to monocultures (10–60{\%} of herbage yield).},

abstract = {Shrubs are usually dominated species for desert ecosystems, and resource islands often occurred around shrubs. It is widely considered that soils beneath shrub canopy have higher microbial diversity and biomass than those outside of the canopy. However, it remains poorly understood how shrubs affect this resource islands along soil profile and functional consequence on soil microbial community changes. Here, we showed distinct patterns of soil physiochemical properties and microbial communities along a soil profile outward from the taproot of Haloxylon ammodendron (C.A.Mey.) in two soils with contrasting textures: Torripsamments and Haplocalcids (USDA Soil Taxonomy). Soil samples were collected in circles with radii of 5, 40, 100 and 200 cm respectively around the taproot in four randomly selected horizontal directions, and from respective depths of 0-20, 20-60 and 60-100 cm. Microbial biomass and community composition were examined using a chloroform fumigation extraction and phospholipid fatty acids method. Redundancy analysis showed that the spatial variability of soil microbial communities was closely correlated with that of soil water and nutrients in both soils. Soil microbial biomass, soil water and nutrient contents had a similar decreasing trend along the increasing distance from the taproot. The coarse-textured Torripsamments showed stronger variability of soil water and nutrient contents than the fine-textured Haplocacids within the resource islands, and similar results were observed for soil microbial biomass. A clear trend of spatial variability (outward from taproot) for various microbial groups was observed in Torripsamments, but not in Haplocalcids. The biomass decreased to a lesser extent for total fungi than bacteria, and for Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria in Torripsamments. Our results suggest that the presence of H. ammodendron plays an important role in shaping the spatial variability of microbial communities in these desert ecosystems. Soil texture may determine the intensity of their spatial variability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a synthesis of experiments conducted in a tropical tree plantation established in 2001 and consisting of 22 plots of 45m×45m with either one, three or six native tree species. We examined the changes in carbon (C) pools (trees, herbaceous vegetation, litter, coarse woody debris (CWD), and mineral topsoil at 0-10cm depth) and fluxes (decomposition of CWD and litter, as well as soil respiration) both through time and among diversity levels. Between 2001 and 2009 the aboveground C pools increased, driven by trees. Across diversity levels, the mean observed aboveground C pool was 7.9±2.5Mgha-1in 2006 and 20.4±7.4Mgha-1in 2009, a 158{\%} increase. There was no significant diversity effect on the observed aboveground C pool, but we found a significant decrease in the topsoil C pool, with a mean value of 34.5±2.4Mgha-1in 2001 and of 25.7±5.7Mgha-1in 2009 (F1,36=52.12, p{\textless}0.001). Assuming that the biomass C pool in 2001 was negligible ({\textless}1Mgha-1), then the plantation gained in C, on average, ∼20 and lost ∼9Mgha-1in biomass and soil respectively, for an overall gain of ∼11Mgha-1over 8 years. Across the entire data set, we uncovered significant effects of diversity on CWD decomposition (diversity: F2,393=15.93, p{\textless}0.001) and soil respiration (monocultures vs mixtures: t=15.35, df=11, p{\textless}0.05) and a marginally significant time×diversity interaction on the loss of total C from the mineral topsoil pool (see above). Monthly CWD decomposition was significantly faster in monocultures (35.0±24.1{\%}) compared with triplets (31.3±21.0{\%}) and six-species mixtures (31.9±26.8{\%}), while soil respiration was higher in monocultures than in mixtures (t=15.35, df=11, p{\textless}0.001). Path analyses showed that, as diversity increases, the links among the C pools and fluxes strengthen significantly. Our results demonstrate that tree diversity influences the processes governing the changes in C pools and fluxes following establishment of a tree plantation on a former pasture. We conclude that the choice of tree mixtures for afforestation in the tropics can have a marked influence on C pools and dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Species interactions can play a major role in shaping evolution in new environments. In theory, species interactions can either stimulate evolution by promoting coevolution or inhibit evolution by constraining ecological opportunity. The relative strength of these effects should vary as species richness increases, and yet there has been little evidence for evolution of component species in communities. We evolved bacterial microcosms containing between 1 and 12 species in three different environments. Growth rates and yields of isolates that evolved in communities were lower than those that evolved in monocultures, consistent with recent theory that competition constrains species to specialize on narrower sets of resources. This effect saturated or reversed at higher levels of richness, consistent with theory that directional effects of species interactions should weaken in more diverse communities. Species varied considerably, however, in their responses to both environment and richness levels. Mechanistic models and experiments are now needed to understand and predict joint evolutionary dynamics of species in diverse communities.},

The large effort to compile global plant functional trait databases largely for the purpose of mapping and analyzing the spatial distribution of function has resulted in very sparse data matrices thereby limiting progress. Identifying robust methodologies to gap fill or impute trait values in these databases is an important objective. Here I argue that existing statistical tools from phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to rapidly impute values into global plant functional trait databases due to the large amount of phylogenetic signal often in trait data. In particular, statistical models of phylogenetic signal in traits can be generated from existing data and used to predict missing values of closely related species often with a high degree of accuracy thereby facilitating the continental-scale mapping of plant function. Despite the promise of this approach, I also discuss potential pitfalls and future challenges that will need to be addressed.},

abstract = {Contemporary biodiversity experiments, in which plant species richness is manipulated and aboveground productivity of the system measured, generally demonstrate that lowering plant species richness reduces productivity. However, we propose that community density may in part compensate for this reduction of productivity at low diversity. We conducted a factorial experiment in which plant functional group richness was held constant at three, while plant species richness increased from three to six to 12 species and community density from 440 to 1050 to 2525 seedlings m-2. Response variables included density, evenness and above- and belowground biomass at harvest. The density gradient converged slightly during the course of the experiment due to about 10{\%} mortality at the highest sowing density. Evenness measured in terms of aboveground biomass at harvest significantly declined with density, but the effect was weak. Overall, aboveground, belowground and total biomass increased significantly with species richness and community density. However, a significant interaction between species richness and community density occurred for both total and aboveground biomass, indicating that the diversity- productivity relationship was flatter at higher than at lower density. Thus, high species richness enabled low-density communities to reach productivity levels otherwise seen only at high density. The relative contributions of the three functional groups C3, C4 and nitrogen-fixers to aboveground biomass were less influenced by community density at high than at low species richness. We interpret the interaction effects between community density and species richness on community biomass by expanding findings about constant yield and size variation from monocultures to plant mixtures. {\textcopyright} 2005 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.

Removal of a particular pollutant is typically associated with a specific microbial functional group, therefore employment of design and operational methodologies that enhance the activity of that group will better optimize performance. Redox condition is a manipulable parameter that can be used to optimize growth of a targeted functional group, therefore factors influencing the TW redox condition and its influence on organic carbon removal mechanisms are emphasized. Environmental factors influencing growth and activity of N and S cycling microbes (including temperature, pH, salinity, plant species selection and availability of organic carbon and/or inhibiting substances) are discussed with particular attention to factors that might be manipulated. This information is used to offer design and operational methodologies that might enhance growth of a desirable microbial functional group and project what additional microbially-focused research is required to better optimize TW performance. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Stormwater biofilters are an important part of the urban landscape in many Australian cities. Until recently, plant species have been selected primarily for their survivability and aesthetics. However, recent research has identified specific species that enhance biofilter functions such as pollutant removal and flood prevention (via infiltration). Prior to these findings, little attention was paid to developing planting plans that included plant species with specific functional traits, such as specific root length (SRL), percent fine roots (PFR), and relative growth rate (RGR); rather, biofilter planting plans often suggest planting a relatively large number of plant species with the expectation that some species will not survive due to competition and environmental factors. As these unsuited species are lost, species diversity might be expected to be lower in older biofilters. However, it is unknown whether biodiversity or functional diversity (i.e., the diversity of functional traits) actually decreases as biofilters age. To investigate this question, we surveyed plant communities in 32 biofilters along a chronosequence in Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. From these data, we calculated biodiversity and functional diversity indices from trait (i.e., SRL, PFR, and RGR) data available in the literature for dominant plant species. We found that, although plant species diversity is lower in older biofilters, functional diversity is unaffected by age. These trends suggest biofilter plant communities maintain functional diversity despite losing biodiversity over time. A better understanding of how plant functional traits relate to ecosystem functions would let us design biofilters with better performance and value.},

abstract = {Consumer diversity effects on ecosystem functioning are highly context dependent and are determined by consumer specialization and other consumer and prey specific traits such as growth and grazing rates. Despite complex reciprocal interactions between consumers and their prey, few experimental studies have focused on prey diversity effects on consumer dynamics and trophic transfer. In microbial microcosms, we investigated effects of algal prey diversity (one, two and four species) on the production, evenness and grazing rates of 4 ciliate consumers, differing in grazing preferences and rates. Prey diversity increased prey biovolume in the absence of consumers and had opposing effects on different consumers, depending on their specialization and their preferred prey. Consumers profited from prey mixtures compared to monocultures of non-preferred prey, but responded negatively if preferred prey species were offered together with other species. Prey diversity increased consumer evenness by preventing dominance of specific consumers, demonstrating that the loss of prey species may have cascading effects resulting in reduced consumer diversity. Our study emphasizes that not only the degree of specialization but also the selectivity for certain prey species within the dietary niche may alter the consequences of changing prey diversity in a food web context.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using a floating treatment wetland for removal of dissolved metals from urban runoff under full-scale conditions. The study site is a retention pond located in northeast Nantes (France) that receives the storm water runoff from a section of highway (27,000 vehicles/day, basin surface 375m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). Three floating marshes were anchored in the retention pond, each raft with a surface area of 1.5m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (125cm×120cm) supporting 16 plants (8 Juncus, 8 Carex). After 4 months, plant samples were harvested, mineralized and analyzed by atomic spectrometry absorption to determine cadmium, nickel and zinc concentrations. Analysis showed Ni concentration in leaves between 23 and 31$\mu$g/g{\textless}inf{\textgreater}drymatter{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, and between 113 and 131$\mu$g/g in roots. Accumulation of Zn was 45-80$\mu$g/g in leaves and 168-210$\mu$g/g in roots. The root/leaf ratio, between 2.6 and 5.7 for Ni and Zn respectively, highlights the important function of roots in heavy metal accumulation. No cadmium accumulation was detected in plants. All three metals were also present in the biofilm on roots. Moreover, roots demonstrated a capacity to filter particulates. This study shows that floating marshes can effectively remove some metals from stormwater ponds.},

abstract = {1. Advances in root ecology have revealed that root standing biomass is higher in species-rich plant communities than in species-poor communities. Currently, we do not know whether this below-ground diversity effect is the result of enhanced root production or reduced root mortal- ity or both, which is essential information to understand ecosystem functioning, as it deter- mines C sequestration and N dynamics in soil. 2. Minirhizotron observations were combined with root coring in five different plant commu- nities (four monocultures and the respective mixture). Molecular markers were used to quanti- tatively determine species abundance in mixed root biomass samples in order to track shifts in below-ground species composition. In addition, a litterbag experiment was performed to study root decomposition independent of root mortality. 3. Root length production was greater and root length loss was lower in the mixture than expected from monocultures in all years. Simulations suggest that at least two species must have had reduced losses in mixture compared to monoculture. However, the diversity effects on root mortality may partially be explained by selection effects as the species with the longest root life span became dominant in the mixtures. Root length loss from minirhizotrons was very low; the combination of minirhizotron length measurements with root biomass estimates from coring suggested underestimation of root loss in minirhizotrons over time. Root decomposition was not affected by diversity. 4. Diversity enhanced root length production and decreased root loss, resulting in below- ground overyielding. With decomposition unaffected, our results suggest that root mortality is reduced with increasing diversity. Future studies have to reveal the generality of our observa- tions in larger scale biodiversity experiments by using species having a wider variety of root traits.},

abstract = {Increasing productivity of mixtures as compared to monocultures has been reported from numerous experimental studies, but so far the variable contribution of individual species to higher mixture productivity in biodiversity experiments is not well understood. To address this issue, we quantified the productivity of 60 species in monocultures and mixtures of varying species richness (2, 4, 8, 16, 60) and functional group number and composition (1, 2, 3, 4; legumes, grasses, small herbs, tall herbs) and tested how species properties are related to species performance in mixtures in the third year after sowing. We analysed monoculture biomass, plant biomass from separately grown plant individuals (=estimate of plant growth rates), and the monoculture resource-use characteristics canopy height and structure (leaf area index) as indicators for light acquisition, and soil nitrate concentration (=estimate of depletion of plant available nitrogen) and biomass:N ratios (=estimate of biomass produced per unit plant N) as indicators for nitrogen acquisition and use. High monoculture productivity was related to different combinations of resource-use characteristics. The biomass of a species and its proportional contribution to mixture biomass correlated positively with species relative yields, suggesting that highly productive mixture species were most important for an overyielding of mixtures. Although monoculture biomass was a significant predictor for species performance in mixtures except for grasses, a combination of monoculture biomass, plant growth rates and resource-use traits associated with nutrient and light acquisition explained non-legume species performance best. Legume performance was best associated with their monoculture biomass and traits associated with light acquisition. In spite of the fact that high species performance in mixtures was associated with a species' competitive ability as represented by monoculture productivity, growth rates and resource-use traits, our results suggest that species uniqueness in resource acquisition strategies increases the chance for niche differentiation among overyielding species. {\textcopyright} 2010 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

First, we present an updated version of a published megaphylogeny of vascular plants that can be used in studies of plant ecology and biogeography. Second, we develop a tool that can be used by botanists and plant ecologists to generate phylogenetic hypotheses in three scenarios. Third, we use a set of regional assemblages of angiosperm trees in North America as a model system to evaluate the effect of differences in phylogenies generated using the three scenarios on the quantification of phylogenetic properties and the relationship between measures of phylogenetic properties and environment.MethodsThe taxonomy and nomenclature of plant species in the megaphylogeny were standardized according to The Plant List (version 1.1). A tool for generating phylogenies was created using the R language. The robustness of derived phylogenies was evaluated using correlation and regression analyses.Important FindingsAn updated megaphylogeny of vascular plants (PhytoPhylo) and a tool for reconstructing phylogenies of seed plants (S.PhyloMaker) were generated. Our study shows that phylogenies generated by S.PhyloMaker using the PhytoPhylo megaphylogeny as a backbone are nearly as good as phylogeny resolved at the species level when using derived phylogenies to quantify phylogenetic properties (e.g. phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic relatedness) of biological assemblages, and that S.PhyloMaker-generated phylogenies are robust for studies of community ecology and biogeography, particularly those seeking for patterns of phylogenetic properties along environmental gradients.},

Previous experimental studies suggest that foliar and root pathogen abundance and disease severity decrease with increasing tree species diversity, but evidences from natural forests are rare. Here, we tested whether foliar fungal disease incidence was negatively affected by tree species diversity in different forest types across Europe. We measured the foliar fungal disease incidence on 16 different tree species in 209 plots in six European countries, representing a forest-type gradient from the Mediterranean to boreal forests. Forest plots of single species (monoculture plots) and those with different combinations of two to five tree species (mixed species plots) were compared. Specifically, we analyzed the influence of tree species richness, functional type (conifer vs. broadleaved) and phylogenetic diversity on overall fungal disease incidence. The effect of tree species richness on disease incidence varied with latitude and functional type. Disease incidence tended to increase with tree diversity, in particular in northern latitudes. Disease incidence decreased with tree species richness in conifers, but not in broadleaved trees. However, for specific damage symptoms, no tree species richness effects were observed. Although the patterns were weak, susceptibility of forests to disease appears to depend on the forest site and tree type.},

This study investigated the impact different climates have on the retention performance of identical green roofs installed in London Ontario (humid continental), Calgary Alberta (semi-arid, continental), and Halifax Nova Scotia (humid, maritime). Drier climates were found to have greater percent cumulative stormwater retention with Calgary (67{\%}) having significantly better percent retention than both London (48{\%}) and Halifax (34{\%}). However, over the same study period the green roof in London retained the greatest depth of stormwater (598 mm), followed by the green roof in Halifax (471 mm) and then Calgary (411 mm). The impact of climate was largest for medium sized storms where the antecedent moisture condition (AMC) at the beginning of a rainfall event governs retention performance. Importantly AMC was a very good predictor of stormwater retention, with similar retention at all three sites for a given AMC, emphasizing that AMC is a relevant indicator of retention performance in any climate. For large rainfall events (i.e., {\textgreater}45 mm) green roof average retention ranged between 16{\%} and 29{\%} in all cities. Overall, drier climates have superior retention due to lower AMC in the media. However, moderate and wet climates still provide substantial total volume reduction benefits.},

We recognize communities of bacteria as integral and functionally important components of diverse habitats, ranging from soil collectives to the human microbiome. To function as productive communities, bacteria coordinate metabolic functions, often requiring shifts in growth and development. The hallmark of cellular development, which we characterize as physiological change in response to environmental stimuli, is a defining feature of many bacterial interspecies interactions. Bacterial communities rely on chemical exchanges to provide the cues for developmental change. Traditional methods in microbiology focus on isolation and characterization of bacteria in monoculture, separating the organisms from the surroundings in which interspecies chemical communication has relevance. Developing multispecies experimental systems that incorporate knowledge of bacterial physiology and metabolism with insights from biodiversity and metagenomics shows great promise for understanding interspecies chemical communication in the microbial world.},

abstract = {1. An important factor limiting the wider application of constructed ecosystems for bioremediation of sites contaminated by toxic chemicals is their relatively low efficiency of contaminant removal. Although there is growing evidence that species-rich ecosystems may out-perform species-poor ecosystems in removing excessive nutrients from water through niche partitioning, it remains unknown whether diverse ecosystems are more efficient in removing toxic chemicals from the environment, and if they are, by what mechanisms diverse ecosystems can lead to enhanced removals. 2. In this study, we exposed aquatic algal microcosm ecosystems of varying species richness to a realistic cadmium (Cd) contamination scenario. We explore the mechanisms of Cd removal by assemblages with differing diversity and consider the potential role of diversity on Cd bioremediation. 3. Our results suggest that Cd removal efficiencies of the algal microcosms increased with species richness. Furthermore, we found that 45{\%} of all polycultures out-performed the monocultures of their most efficient component species in removing Cd from the growth substrates (referred as to 'over Cd removal'). However, the average Cd removal efficiency of the most diverse (eight-species) polycultures was not higher than that of the most efficient monoculture (i.e. the algal species most tolerant to Cd) in this study. We also showed that the observed over Cd removal could be largely ascribed to the enhanced biomass yields of the polycultures, which were mainly driven by the positive effects of Cd-tolerant species on Cd-sensitive species. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that some algal polycultures containing both Cd-tolerant and Cd-sensitive species may show over Cd removal through facilitation provided by Cd-tolerant species. These polycultures are likely to be assembled and applied to achieve Cd removals higher than those of their most efficient component species in monoculture. Given that species-rich ecosystems tend to be more environmentally stable than ones with fewer species, it would be prudent to employ diverse polycultures rather than risk the loss of individual monocultures.},

abstract = {In the last two decades, the relationship between diversity and stability/ecosystem functioning has been widely discussed and has become a central issue in ecology. Here, we assessed the relationship between wetland plant diversity and community resilience after a disturbance. Our study area was located in the Upper Paran{\'{a}} River floodplain (Brazil). An experiment was carried out in situ (18 1m × 1m plots with richness varying from 1 to 18 species). In each plot, we recorded the number of species, total per cent vegetation cover and per cent age cover of each species. The above-ground biomass of wetland plants was removed, simulating a disturbance by animal trampling or an extreme flood. The recovery of vegetation was monitored over 3 months. According to a linear regression, the recovery of wetland plants was positively correlated with diversity. Comparisons with plots containing monocultures of one of the dominant species (Polygonum stelligerum) suggested that this species did not overyield in mixed cultures. Thus, our experiments indicate that the higher resilience in richer plots after a disturbance is mainly due to the fact that species have different resource use requirements (complementarity effect) and not due to the presence of a single, more productive species. Our experiment carried out in a more real condition (in situ) showed that biodiversity is important to wetland functioning and stability, paralleling the results obtained in laboratory and mesocosms experiments. These results also suggest that the loss of plant diversity in our study area could compromise community recovery following strong disturbances. {\textcopyright} 2012 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {The effects of herbivores and diversity on plant communities have been studied separately but rarely in combination. We conducted two concurrent experiments over 3 years to examine how tree seedling diversity, density and herbivory affected forest regeneration. One experiment factorially manipulated plant diversity (one versus 15 species) and the presence/absence of deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We found that mixtures outperformed monocultures only in the presence of deer. Selective browsing on competitive dominants and associational protection from less palatable species appear responsible for this herbivore-driven diversity effect. The other experiment manipulated monospecific plant density and found little evidence for negative density dependence. Combined, these experiments suggest that the higher performance in mixture was owing to the acquisition of positive interspecific interactions rather than the loss of negative intraspecific interactions. Overall, we emphasize that realistic predictions about the consequences of changing biodiversity will require a deeper understanding of the interaction between plant diversity and higher trophic levels. If we had manipulated only plant diversity, we would have missed an important positive interaction across trophic levels: diverse seedling communities better resist herbivores, and herbivores help to maintain seedling diversity.},

abstract = {Plants furnish soil with organic carbon (OC) compounds that fuel soil microorganisms, but whether individual plant species – or plants with unique traits – do so uniquely is uncertain. We evaluated soil microbial processes within a wetland in which areas dominated by a distinct plant species (cattail –Typha sp.; purple loosestrife –Lythrum salicaria L.; reed canarygrass –Phalaris arundinacea L.) co-mingled. We also established an experimental plot with plant shoot removal. The Phalaris area had more acidic soil pH (7.08 vs. 7.27–7.57), greater amount of soil organic matter (19.0{\%} vs. 9.0–11.5{\%}), and the slowest production rates of CO2 (0.10 vs. 0.21–0.46 $\mu$mol kg−1 s−1) and CH4 (0.040 vs. 0.054–0.079 nmol kg−1 s−1). Nitrogen cycling was dominated by net nitrification, with similar rates (17.2–18.9 mg kg−1 14 days−1) among the four sampling areas. In the second part of the study, we emplaced soil cores that either allowed root in-growth or excluded roots to evaluate how roots directly affect soil CO2 and CH4. The three plant species had similar amounts of root growth (ca 290 g m−2 year−1). Fungal biomass was similar in soils with root in-growth versus root exclusion, regardless of dominant plant species. Rates of soil CO2 production did not differ with root in-growth versus root exclusion, and added glucose increased CO2 production rates by only 35{\%}. Root in-growth did lead to greater rates of CH4 production; albeit, addition of glucose had much greater effect on CH4 production (1.24 nmol kg−1 s−1) compared with controls without added glucose (0.058 nmol kg−1 s−1). Our data revealed relatively few subtle differences in soil characteristics and processes associated with different plant species; albeit, roots had little effect, even inhibiting some microbial processes. This research highlights the need for both field and experimental studies in long-established monocultures of plant species to understand the role of plant biodiversity in soil function.},

abstract = {The ability of soil microbial communities to withstand and recover from disturbance or stress is important for the functional stability of forest ecosystems. However, the relationship between the community responses of soil microbes and variation in tree mixtures vs functional composition remains poorly understood. We investigated soil biochemical properties and soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought in three 4-year old tree monocultures (Acer saccharum Marsh, Larix laricina (Duroi) K. Koch, Pinus strobus L.) and two tree species combinations (L. laricina/A. saccharum and L. laricina/P. strobus) planted in a high-density tree field experiment located in southern Quebec, Canada. The experimentally imposed drought stress consisted of maintaining soil material for 30 days at 25{\%} of water holding capacity (WHC). Microbial biomass was assessed immediately after the water stress (resistance) and 15 and 30 days following drought (resilience). Results showed that tree communities influenced soil chemistry, soil respirometry properties and microbial resistance and resilience. We measured significant non-additive (i.e., both synergistic and antagonistic) effects of mixing tree species in some of the soil biochemical properties measured, mostly in the L. laricina/A. saccharum mixture. However, we did not find non-additive effects of tree mixtures on microbial resistance and resilience. A structural equation modelling analysis revealed that resistance and resilience were mostly modulated by direct effects of community weight means (CWM) of leaf litter lignin content and mineralisable N, and by indirect links from tree density and CWM of leaf litter N content via mineralisable N. This study suggests that tree species identity surpassed species mixtures as a key driver of soil microbial resistance and resilience. We showed a trade-off between microbial resistance and resilience in soil food webs, which is consistent with ecological theory. Our results indicate that differences in functional traits between tree species may rapidly be reflected in divergent soil biochemical properties, and that these differences can in turn drive soil microbial resistance and resilience to drought.

abstract = {1. The storage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil is important ecosystem functions. Grassland biodiversity experiments have shown a positive effect of plant diversity on soil C and N storage. However, these experiments all included legumes, which constitute an important N input through N2-fixation. Indeed, the results of these experiments suggest that N2 fixation by legumes is a major driver of soil C and N storage. 2. We studied whether plant diversity affects soil C and N storage in the absence of legumes. In an 11-year grassland biodiversity experiment without legumes, we measured soil C and N stocks. We further determined above-ground biomass productivity, standing root biomass, soil organic matter decomposition and N mineralization rates to understand the mechanisms underlying the change in soil C and N stocks in relation to plant diversity and their feedbacks to plant productivity. 3. We found that soil C and N stocks increased by 18{\%} and 16{\%} in eight-species mixtures com- pared to the average of monocultures of the same species, respectively. Increased soil C and N stocks were mainly driven by increased C input and N retention, resulting from enhanced plant pro- ductivity, which surpassed enhanced C loss from decomposition. Importantly, higher soil C and N stocks were associated with enhanced soil N mineralization rates, which can explain the strengthen- ing of the positive diversity–productivity relationship observed in the last years of the experiment. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrated that also in the absence of legumes, plant species richness promotes soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks via increased plant productivity. In turn, enhanced soil C and N stocks showed a positive feedback to plant productivity via enhanced N mineralization, which could further accelerate soil C and N storage in the long term.},

abstract = {Sphagnum magellanicum Brid. is a worldwide distributed peat moss and an ecosystem-engineer in temperate and boreal bog ecosystems suggesting a great adaptive potential to different environmental conditions. Phenotypes of S. magellanicum have been described as one species so far, although this has been questioned by the detection of several genetic groups in a recent global study. Concordant with morphological uniformity, our analyses of Mid- to Northern European plants revealed only minimal variation in nuclear nrITS and plastid rps4 sequences. However, we detected two distinct genetic groups within Europe by analyzing microsatellite data of 298 individuals from 27 populations. Plants formed an Eastern and a Western European cluster, with overlapping areas in northern Germany and southern Sweden where plants of both clusters coexist within populations but show no signs of admixture. These two cryptic taxa seem therefore to be reproductively isolated. Bayesian analyses indicated that reproductive isolation occurred before the end of the late Pleistocene glaciations. After the meltdown of the glaciers, both clusters colonized northern and central Europe from glacial refugia in the West and possibly from Euro-Siberian populations. To test for divergent adaptation to environmental conditions, we exposed plants of both clusters to experimental climate warming treatments at two different plant-diversity levels (monocultures vs. mixtures) for two years. Despite their different evolutionary history, plants of both genetic clusters responded equally to climate treatments in our southern common garden near Potsdam, Germany. However, only eastern cluster populations benefited from plant-community diversity and increased their biomass in mixtures. These differences in their ecological niche match the diverging microhabitat preferences observed in situ and may effectively hamper genetic exchange if distances between microhabitats are too large for Sphagnum sperm movement.},

abstract = {Soil erosion is a key threat to many ecosystems, especially in subtropical China where high erosion rates occur. While the mechanisms that induce soil erosion on agricultural land are well understood, soil erosion processes in forests have rarely been studied. Throughfall kinetic energy (TKE) is influenced in manifold ways and often determined by the tree's leaf and architectural traits. We investigated the role of species identity in mono-specific stands on TKE by asking to what extent TKE is species-specific and which leaf and architectural traits account for variation in TKE. We measured TKE of 11 different tree species planted in monocultures in a biodiversity-ecosystem-functioning experiment in subtropical China, using sand-filled splash cups during five natural rainfall events in summer 2013. In addition, 14 leaf and tree architectural traits were measured and linked to TKE. Our results showed that TKE was highly species-specific. Highest TKE was found below Choerospondias axillaris and Sapindus saponaria, while Schima superba showed lowest TKE. These species-specific effects were mediated by leaf habit, leaf area (LA), leaf pinnation, leaf margin, stem diameter at ground level (GD), crown base height (CBH), tree height, number of branches and leaf area index (LAI) as biotic factors and throughfall as abiotic factor. Among these, leaf habit, tree height and LA showed the highest effect sizes on TKE and can be considered as major drivers of TKE. TKE was positively influenced by LA, GD, CBH, tree height, LAI, and throughfall amount while it was negatively influenced by the number of branches. TKE was lower in evergreen, simple leaved and dentate leaved than in deciduous, pinnated or entire leaved species. Our results clearly showed that soil erosion in forest plantations can be mitigated by the appropriate choice of tree species.[on SciFinder (R)]},

abstract = {1. Plant functional traits have revealed trade-offs related to life-history adaptations, geographi-cal distributions, and ecosystem processes. Fine roots are essential in plant resource acquisition and play an important role in soil carbon cycling. Nonetheless, root trait variation is still poorly quantified and rarely related to the rest of the plant. 2. We examined chemical and morphological traits of 34 temperate arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species, representing three main angiosperm clades (super-orders asterid, magnoliid and rosid). We tested to what extent fine root chemical and morphological traits were correlated similarly to the leaf economical spectrum (LES) or were structured by ancestral affiliations among species. 3. Root traits did not display the same trade-offs as leaves (e.g. specific root length was not cor-related with root N, whereas specific leaf area was correlated with leaf N). Moreover, 75{\%} of below-ground traits were phylogenetically structured according to Pagel's k and Abouheif's C mean autocorrelation tests, as opposed to 28{\%} of above-ground traits. Magnoliids showed thicker, less branched roots than asterids or rosids, but rosid roots exhibited lower N and higher non-acid-hydrolysable (e.g. lignin) content than other species. In contrast, leaf traits did not dif-fer significantly among super-orders. At the whole-tree level, chemical traits such as nitrogen tis-sue content and lignin content were correlated between above and below-ground organs. 4. The distribution of root traits in woody temperate trees was better explained by shared ancestry than by the nutrient content and structural trade-offs expected by the LES hypothesis. Root chemistry and morphology differed substantially among species belonging to different super-orders, suggesting deep divergences in resource acquisition strategies among major angiosperm groups. Although we found partial support for the idea of whole-plant integration based on corresponding nitrogen content across all organs (i.e. a plant economics spectrum), our study stresses phylogenetic affiliation as the primary driver of root trait distributions among angiosperms, a pattern that could be easily overlooked based solely on above-ground observations.},
annote = {- A study looking at the phylogentic structure of root traits across 34 temperate tree species 
- A large percentage of belowground traits were phylogenetically structured compared to leaf traits. Leaf traits could be more influenced by environmental conditionsa nd life-history strategies than belowground traits
- Reason: slow-growing roots were the precursor version to fine roots because of their mycoorzhizal dependency for nutrient uptake in AM trees. Environmental changes eventually lead to finer roots
- Cool finding: evolutionar history shapes both individal root links and integration of root orders
- Another cool finding: leaf and root traits wre decoupled except for N , in contast to Reich 2014 predictions. Possibly because roots have more trait combinations for carbon maintenance and construction costs},

abstract = {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OUmod- els possess selective optima that formalize the notion of adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit models, to test the models against data using maximum-like- lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples. Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to utilize more of the information content of com- parative data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a model selection framework to simultaneously compare a variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess alternative evolutionary explanations.},

Curling movements of the upper leaves associated with the beginning desiccation of the uppermost parts of a turf allowed increased penetration of light to greater depth with decreasing WC. The capacity to fix carbon declined steeply with depth: below ca. 9 mm no net CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} uptake occurred, even when removing the shading parts above. The potential rates of photosynthesis in different depths were highly correlated with chlorophyll content, but not nitrogen content. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Indoor air quality has become a growing concern as people are spending more time indoors, combined with the construction of highly sealed buildings that promote thermal efficiency. Particulate matter (PM) is a common indoor air pollutant, with exposure to high concentrations associated with several detrimental health outcomes. Active botanical biofilters or functional green walls are becoming increasingly efficient and have the potential to mitigate high suspended PM concentrations. These systems, however, require further development before they become competitive with industry standard in-room air filters. Whilst the plant growth substrate in active biofilters can act as a filter medium, it was previously not known whether the plant component of these systems played a function in PM filtration. This study thus examines the influence of the botanical component on active green wall PM single pass removal efficiency (SPRE), with a focus on evaluating the air filtration features of different plant species in green wall modules. All tested botanical biofilters outperformed biofilters that consisted only of substrate. Green walls using different plant species had different single pass removal efficiencies, with fern species recording the highest removal efficiencies across all measured particle sizes (Nephrolepis exaltata bostoniensis SPRE for PM0.3-0.5and PM5-10= 45.78{\%} and 92.46{\%} respectively). Higher removal efficiencies were associated with increased pressure drop across the biofilter. An assessment of plant morphological data suggested that the root structure of the plants strongly influenced removal efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential to enhance active botanical biofiltration technology with appropriate plant species selection.},

abstract = {Global predictions of increasing mean temperature and its variance result in concerns about the fate of biodiversity under future climatic conditions. On the local scale of interacting species, the response of diversity to warming will depend much on the change in interspecific interactions such as competition or predation. Using a phytoplankton model community, we conducted a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial long-term microcosm experiment (16 months) with an underlying seasonal temperature profile. We manipulated the mean temperature (Tmean), the temperature variance (Tvar), and the presence of consumers (ciliates) and monitored treatment effects on algal biomass, species composition and species richness. Temperature effects on algal biomass depended on the seasonal development and consumer presence. Algal biomass decreased with increasing Tmean at consumer absence, but increased at consumer presence. Overall, algal biomass decreased with increasing Tvar. Consumer presence reduced algal biomass from summer to winter, but then ciliates and the consumer effect disappeared. Almost all treatment combinations collapsed to monocultures after 16 months, but extinction occurred faster at higher Tmean (especially at consumer absence) and slower at consumer presence (especially at higher Tmean). Contrasting our predictions, increasing Tvar reduced richness and increased extinction rate. The treatment effects on biomass and richness were not independent, as algal species richness and biomass were positively correlated. Moreover, accelerated loss of species was consistently correlated to higher temporal variability in biomass. In conclusion, altered temperature regimes strongly affected algal biomass and diversity by interdependently altering competitive and consumer interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current agricultural practices are based on growing monocultures or binary mixtures over large areas, with a resultant impoverishing effect on biodiversity at several trophic levels. The effects of increasing the biodiversity of a sward mixture on dry matter yield and unsown species invasion were studied. METHODS: A field experiment involving four grassland species [two grasses--perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata)--and two legumes--red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium repens)], grown in monocultures and mixtures in accordance with a simplex design, was carried out. The legumes were included either as single varieties or as one of two broad genetic-base composites. The experiment was harvested three times a year over three years; dry matter yield and yield of unsown species were determined at each harvest. Yields of individual species and interactions between all species present were estimated through a statistical modelling approach. KEY RESULTS: Species diversity produced a strong positive yield effect that resulted in transgressive over-yielding in the second and third years. Using broad genetic-base composites of the legumes had a small impact on yield and species interactions. Invasion by unsown species was strongly reduced by species diversity, but species identity was also important. Cocksfoot and white clover (with the exception of one broad genetic-base composite) reduced invasion, while red clover was the most invaded species. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that it is possible to increase, and stabilize, the yield of a grassland crop and reduce invasion by unsown species by increasing its species diversity.},

abstract = {In this study, replacement of dominant populations (Phragmites australis and Phalaris arundinacea) in the plant community succession process in the Zhenjiang Waterfront Wetland was approached from three aspects: growth, photosynthesis, and specific competitive characteristics. The productivity of Phragmites, based on intrinsic rate of increase and environmental carrying capacity of the several chosen growth indices (plant length, sheath height, and biomass), was significantly higher than that of Phalaris. Phragmites had a higher photosynthetic rate than Phalaris. However, Phalaris had a markedly lower light compensation point, which suggested that it was capable of better utilization of weak light. This possibly might account for its survival beneath Phragmites. At three different coverage gradients, the relative yield total was greater than 1, indicating a certain degree of complementary resource utilization via niche separation between both species. Significant differences in the competition ratio of both species indicated a superiority of Phragmites over Phalaris in terms of competitive capability. Thus, the Phragmites population tended to exclude the Phalaris population and became the mono-dominant population in the community succession process. For Phalaris, traits such as its better utilization of weak light, its complementary resource utilization, and a partial separation of growth period compared to Phragmites prevented complete replacement of its population to some degree. In this particular study area in the Zhenjiang Waterfront Wetland, the hydrological conditions of the river beach determined by its elevation possibly acted as the dominant regulator of the plant succession process. -{\textregistered} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V},

abstract = {1. While positive effects of biodiversity on temporal stability of communities have been demonstrated in theoretical and empirical studies, diversitystability relationships at the population level remain poorly understood. 2. We investigated temporal variability of plant populations in experimental grassland plots of varying species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 1660 species), functional group richness and composition (presence/absence of legumes grasses small herbs tall herbs) in a long-term biodiversity experiment from 2003 to 2009 (Jena Experiment). 3. Average population stability, defined as the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation of above-ground biomass production over time, differed largely between species but was generally higher in grasses and small herbs than in legumes and tall herbs. Furthermore, population stability was positively related to a species proportional contribution to community biomass. Thus, an increasing number of subordinate species explained lower average population stabilities at higher diversity levels. 4. A negative covariance (CV) across all species-richness levels suggested negatively correlated species dynamics. Species belonging to different functional groups fluctuated asynchronously, while species dynamics within functional groups were more synchronous. Community-wide species synchrony decreased with increasing species richness, and temporal stability at the community level increased. 5. Synthesis: Our results suggest that diversitystability relationships are driven by fluctuations in the population biomass of individual species which are less synchronized in more diverse than in less diverse mixtures and monocultures. Dominant plant species tend to be more stabilized than subdominant species, independently of community species richness. However, asynchrony of population dynamics outweighs decreasing population stability with increasing species richness, resulting in higher temporal stability at the plant community level.},

abstract = {Abstract. Three common Appalachian plant species (Juncus effusus L., Scirpus validus L., and Typha latifolia L.) were planted into small-scale constructed wetlands receiving primary treated wastewater. The experimental design included two wetland gravel depths (45 and 60 cm) and five planting treatments (each species in monoculture, an equal mixture of the three species, and controls without vegetation), with two replicates per depth  planting combination. Inflow rates (19 L day−1) and frequency (3 times day−1) were designed to simulate full-scale constructed wetlands as currently used for domestic wastewater treatment in West Virginia. Influent wastewater and the effluent from each wetland were sampled monthly for ten physical, chemical and biological parameters, and plant demographic measurements were made. After passing through these trough wetlands, the average of all treatments showed a 70{\%} reduction in total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 50 to 60{\%} reduction in nitrogen (TKN), ammonia and phosphate, and a reduction of fecal coliforms by three orders of magnitude. Depth of gravel (45 or 60 cm) had little effect on wetland treatment ability, but did influence Typha and Scirpus growth patterns. Gravel alone provided significant wastewater treatment, but vegetation further improved many treatment efficiencies. Typha significantly out-performed Juncus and Scirpus both in growth and in effluent quality improvement. There was also some evidence that the species mixture out-performed species monocultures. Typha was the superior competitor in mixtures, but a decline in Typha growth with distance from the influent pipe suggested that nutrients became limiting or toxicities may have developed.},

abstract = {In March 1999 five seed-mixtures were sown on a shallow substrate bed on a roof near Bernburg. The aim was to study the effect of adding annuals, or cuttings of several sedum-species, respectively, instead of the usual high percentage of grass-seeds, in order to optimise the coverage and density, even without a high amount of grasses in the first and second year after sowing. A second factor involved two different fertilisers. Only on fertilized plots in the second year was a covering rate {\textgreater} 60{\%} achieved. The influence of fertilizer in the second year was substantially larger than the effect of the seed-mixtures. Suitable annuals were Gypsophila elegans, Iberis amara, Silene armeria and Xeranthemum annuum, which were able to form aspects in the first year. Gypsophila elegans provided a stable population in the second year. Even without increasing the coverage significantly, it is highly recommended as an addition to seed mixtures because of its flowering aspect. The trial confirms the importance of fertilisation on shallow-substrate roof-gardens. Cuttings of Sedum album, S. sexangulare and S. reflexum can reach high coverage relatively fast, but on larger areas involve higher costs. Even a relatively low addition of 10 g/m² Sedum to seed mix can result in a significant effect and reduce the proportion of grasses, if fertilised even in the first vegetation period after sowing.},

abstract = {1. The importance of peatlands is being increasingly recognized internationally for both the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services; strategies are being developed world-wide to help maintain their integrity. Prescribed burning has been highlighted as a threat with considerable debate over its use as it is perceived to produce a Calluna vulgaris monoculture and a decline in preferred peat-forming species. 2. We investigated the impact of prescribed burning on vegetation composition and diversity in a long-term experiment at Moor House NNR in northern England. The study comprised a comparison between no-burn reference plots last burned in ca. 1924 and an experiment where all plots were burned in 1954/5. Within the experiment, the effects of very light sheep grazing vs. no grazing and three burning rotations (no-burn since 1954/5, repeat-burning at 10- and 20-year intervals) were tested. 3. Calluna vulgaris and Hypnum jutlandicum cover and bryophyte species richness increased in the least-disturbed, no-burn reference plots, but bryophyte cover did not. Lichen diversity declined. 4. Within the formal experiment, low-intensity sheep grazing had little impact but there were substantive changes produced by the different burning rotations. There was divergence between the burning rotation treatments with the least-disturbed, no-burn treatment changing towards a C. vulgaris–H. jutlandicum community, whereas the most-disturbed 10-year rotation had a much greater abundance of both Eriophorum and Sphagnum spp. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that blanket-bog vegetation on peat responds to prescribed burning in a complex manner. Where burn return interval is long ({\textgreater}20 years), C. vulgaris becomes dominant and there was no evidence that preferred peat-forming species (Eriophorum/Sphagnum) increased. Where burn return interval is short (10 years), E. vaginatum/ Sphagnum abundance increased. We found no evidence to suggest that prescribed burning was deleterious to the abundance of peat-forming species; indeed, it was found to favour them. These results inform conservation management policy for blanket bogs in the UK and more generally for future wildfire-mitigation strategies on dwarf-shrub-dominated peatlands elsewhere. Some lessons for the management of long-term experimental studies are also discussed.},

abstract = {Aims We explore the potential effect of plant diversity on yield and greenhouse gas exchanges in forage mix- tures, identifying potential co-benefits between functions. Methods Using the biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) modelling framework (Connolly et al. 2013), we analyse results from a field experiment where the relative sown proportion of three forage species (a grass, a legume, and a non-legume forb) was varied to obtain a gradient in species proportions and evenness. The exchange rates of N2O, CH4,NH3 and CO2 were mea- sured, together with forage yield and soil inorganic N content. We conducted gas measurements 4 years after sward establishment during the expected period of highest emissions. Results Results support the hypothesis that emission rates are affected by plant diversity. Sown evenness was found to decrease N2O exchange rates, and some evidence was found for a similar negative effect onCH4. Plant composition affected gas exchanges, with legume monocultures showing the highest emission rates for all gases. Diversity also increased yield and modulated NO3 − and NH4 + soil concentrations. Conclusions The integrated analysis of yield and emis- sion response to species diversity allows the identifica- tion of a range of species proportions for which both functions are optimized. Diversifying forage legume- based systems could contribute to mitigation while im- proving ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Tixier M.-S. et al. Acarologia is under free license.Several species of the predatory mite family Phytoseiidae are of major economic importance for biological pest control in crops, including grapevines. Plant diversification in agrosystems is reported to enhance useful biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Thus, agroforestry, which consists in co-planting trees and crops, is assumed to be a possible way to ensure regulation of pest outbreaks by phytoseiid mites. This paper investigates the effect of trees (Pinus pinea and Sorbus domestica) within vineyards on Phytoseiidae communities. Five experimental plots were considered, two where vines were co-planted with P. pinea and S. domestica, and three monoculture plots: vines, P. pinea and S. domestica. Sampling was carried out on vines and trees in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2010 and 2012. A higher Phytoseiidae diversity was observed in agroforestry plots than in monoculture plots. Kampimodromus aberrans (replacing T. [ T.] exhilaratus) seemed to colonize these plots 15 years after its plantation, especially when vines were co-planted with P. pinea. Factors affecting these faunistical changes are discussed. Effects on Phytoseiidae densities differed depending on grape cultivartree species associations. Factors affecting these interactions are discussed; plant diversity does not simply lead to a higher density and diversity of natural enemies.},

abstract = {For algal biofuels to be economically sustainable and avoid exacerbating nutrient pollution, algal cultivation and processing must maximize rates of biofuel production while simultaneously minimizing the consumption of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers. We experimentally tested whether algal polycultures could be engineered to improve N- and P- nutrient-use efficiency compared to monocultures by balancing trade-offs in nutrient-use efficiency and biocrude production. We analyzed the flows of N and P through the processes of cultivation, biocrude production through hydrothermal liquefaction, and nutrient recycling in a laboratory-scale system. None of the six species we examined exhibited high N-efficiency, P-efficiency and biocrude production simultaneously; each had poor performance in at least one function (i.e. {\textless} 25th percentile). Polycultures of 2 to 6 species did not outperform the best species in any single function, but some polycultures exhibited more balanced performance and maintained all three functions at higher levels simultaneously than any of the monocultures (i.e. {\textgreater} 67th percentile). Moreover, certain polycultures came closer to optimizing all three functions than any of the monocultures. By balancing trade-offs between N- and P-efficiency and biocrude production, polycultures could be used to simultaneously reduce the demand for both N and P fertilizers by up to 85{\%}.},

abstract = {1. Some farming practices, like organic farming, lead to greater numbers of weed plants in crop fields. These fields may give us some insights into any benefits that may be gained from biodiversity (e.g. improved pest control services) and allow us to understand the mechanisms behind crop–weed interactions. 2. The influence of two common weeds, lamb's-quarters Chenopodium album and charlock Sinapis arvensis, on performance of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi in spring- sown barley Hordeum vulgare is evaluated in three field experiments. Observations in field experiments indicated that the presence of S. arvensis reduced aphid population development in the barley crop significantly, but this effect was not observed in barley grown with C. album. 3. Observed effects in the field were further studied in laboratory experiments with regard to aphid growth and reproductive performance. Above- and below-ground interactions of S. arvensis and C. album with barley were tested using twin-exposure cages. Aphid perfor- mance was negatively affected when barley plants had root contact with S. arvensis. The results of these laboratory experiments showed a difference in mode of action of the two weeds. 4. Synthesis and applications. The results support the potential of associated resistance, medi- ated by neighbouring plants, in minimizing herbivore damage of focal plants and highlighted the mechanism by which herbivores might be affected. Since chemical exchange between plant neighbours can potentially occur in any plant community, increased understanding could be valuable for existing and new agroecosystems, invasion biology and sustainable crop produc- tion. To get a balance between herbicide and insecticide control, agricultural production sys- tems need to focus on the thresholds of weed and insect tolerance, taking the associated resistance of biodiversity (here weeds) into account. Agricultural biodiversity may provide many long-term benefits over monoculture, from reducing pesticide pollution to preventing insecticide resistance. Our study is an important step forward in general understanding of the effects of vegetational diversity on herbivore population dynamics.},

abstract = {Biodiversity experiments generally report a positive eff ect of plant biodiversity on aboveground biomass (overyielding), which typically increases with time. Various studies also found overyielding for belowground plant biomass, but this has never been measured over time. Also, potential underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Diff erentiation in rooting patterns among plant species and plant functional groups has been proposed as a main driver of the observed biodiversity eff ect on belowground biomass, leading to more effi cient belowground resource use with increasing diversity, but so far there is little evidence to support this. We analyzed standing root biomass and its distribution over the soil profi le, along a 1 – 16 species richness gradient over eight years in the Jena Experiment in Germany, and compared belowground to aboveground overyielding. In our long-term dataset, total root biomass increased with increasing species richness but this eff ect was only apparent after four years. Th e increasingly positive relationship between species richness and root biomass, explaining 12{\%} of overall variation and up to 28{\%} in the last year of our study, was mainly due to decreasing root biomass at low diversity over time. Functional group composition strongly aff ected total standing root biomass, explaining 44{\%} of variation, with grasses and legumes having strong overall positive and negative eff ects, respectively. Functional group richness or interactions between functional group presences did not strongly contribute to overyielding. We found no support for the hypothesis that vertical root diff erentiation increases with species richness, with functional group richness or composition. Other explanations, such as stronger negative plant – soil feedbacks in low-diverse plant communities on standing root biomass and vertical distribution should be considered},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is increasingly used in ecology and evolutionary biology. Yet, in these fields this technique has an important limitation: phylogenetic non-independence exists among taxa, violating the statistical assumptions underlying traditional meta-analytic models. Recently, meta-analytical techniques incorporating phylogenetic information have been developed to address this issue. However, no syntheses have evaluated how often including phylogenetic information changes meta-analytic results. To address this gap, we built phylogenies for and re-analysed 30 published meta-analyses, comparing results for traditional vs. phylogenetic approaches and assessing which characteristics of phylogenies best explained changes in meta-analytic results and relative model fit. Accounting for phylogeny significantly changed estimates of the overall pooled effect size in 47{\{}{\%}{\}} of datasets for fixed-effects analyses and 7{\{}{\%}{\}} of datasets for random-effects analyses. Accounting for phylogeny also changed whether those effect sizes were significantly different from zero in 23 and 40{\{}{\%}{\}} of our datasets (for fixed- and random-effects models, respectively). Across datasets, decreases in pooled effect size magnitudes after incorporating phylogenetic information were associated with larger phylogenies and those with stronger phylogenetic signal. We conclude that incorporating phylogenetic information in ecological meta-analyses is important, and we provide practical recommendations for doing so.},

Temperature regime and identity of fungal species inoculated in monoculture microcosms significantly affected decomposition rates: these increased with temperature, but across all temperature regimes species diversity promoted higher decomposition rate, although functional saturation seemed to occur above three species. In assemblages with at least eight species, litter decomposition was not inhibited by temperature fluctuating regime when compared with constant temperature conditions.

The bio-agronomic performance, the biodiversity dynamics during the two-years experiment, and the pollinating fauna, were analysed.Each plant group was able to efficiently colonize the surface of the roof though in different periods and with various modalities. Thermal insulation of green roof was connected to different development dynamics of leaf canopies. In particular, this cooling effect took place during the peak of the vegetation's growth pattern. As expected, each plant group had differing flowering periods, during which were observed coincided highest rate of pollinator' visits (domestic and solitary bees, bumblebees, lepidoptera, diptera both syrphidae and bombyliidae). The agronomic management, consisting in senescent vegetation mowing, was of crucial importance to ensure the plant equilibrium of spring and summer flowering species. The lack of a prevailing species was highlighted by several biodiversity indexes. On the contrary, early and late flowering species (geophytes) did not require any vegetation management. In conclusion, even if wildflowers exhibit critical aspects in terms of covering dynamics, due to the periodic senescence of vegetation, they represent a valid instrument to improve the biodiversity and the landscape of the Mediterranean urban ecosystem. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Previous studies have attributed the genetic diversity-productivity pattern to differential resource use among genotypes, as many studies have found for species. But here we ask whether suppression of productivity at low intraspecific diversity by soil biota might also drive a positive diversity-productivity relationship. In a previous study, we manipulated genetic diversity by varying the number of Pseudoroegneria accessions growing together in common garden plots, and used soil from that experiment to evaluate soil feedbacks. The total biomass of P. spicata plants grown in unsterilized soil increased with accession richness, specifically when comparing soil that had contained plants from 3-accessions to soil that had contained plants from either 8 or 12 population accessions. Furthermore, soil from high-richness (8 or 12-accession) plots drove neutral feedbacks, whereas soil in the 3-accession plots (3) drove negative feedbacks. However, within each level of richness, there was no relationship between relative yield and feedback. Our results suggest that soil biota might play an integral role in the emerging understanding of the relationship between intraspecific diversity and ecosystem productivity.},

abstract = {Species extinction and immigration are both common in natural communities and the sequence with which species are lost from or added to communities may be crucial to community structure. We experimentally addressed this issue by growing six green algal species in monocultures and all possible two-species mixtures, with two colonization sequences for each mixture. Both convergence and divergence in community structure were observed. The compositions containing particularly productive species were more likely to converge, while those comprising of species with similar monoculture yields were more likely to diverge. The species mixtures with high-yielding initial and low-yielding invading species produced more biomass than monocultures, but mixtures with the opposite assembly order produced only the same level of biomass as monocultures did. To address the diversity ecosystem functioning issue, we estimate complementarity effect by relative yield total (RYT) and selection effect by the correlation between species' monoculture yields and their relative yields in mixtures, respectively. We found overall negative complementarity and positive selection effect in mixtures with high-yielding species as initial colonizers, but positive complementarity and negative selection effect in mixtures with low-yielding initial species. Nonetheless, because we used only up to two species in each microcosm, our results are limited in addressing the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Future research should study the effects of immigration history with many more species involved in community assembly.},

abstract = {Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning experiments have demonstrated that plant biomass of species grown in mixtures is often greater than plant biomass of monocultures (i.e., mixtures over yield). While we understand that plant species utilize resources differently, how a combination of species increases resource use and productivity is not well known, especially in wetland ecosystems. Here, we used a mesocosm experiment to explore diversity effects on plant biomass production and to examine the role of N partitioning as a mechanism for overyielding in wetland ecosystems. Plant functional groups (FGs) represented the unit of diversity, and we included five levels of diversity (0-4 FGs). To test for N partitioning, we used a stable isotope technique to determine niche breadth and proportion similarity of inorganic N use (NO3-and NH4+) for individual FGs as well as mixtures containing 3 and 4 FGs. We found that total plant biomass increased in the first season from an average of 290±60SEgash-freedry mass(AFDM)m-2at the 1 FG level to 490±70gAFDMm-2at the 4 FG level and in the second season from an average of 560±80gAFDMm-2at the 1 FG level to 1000±90gAFDMm-2at the 4 FG level indicating overyielding. Plant species comprising the majority of mesocosm biomass demonstrated preferential uptake of15NO3-, while species with relatively less biomass (e.g., Acorus calamus and Carex crinita) preferred15NH4+. Concentrations of15N in biomass increased with FG richness, but only in the15NO3-treatment. Niche breadth did not vary among levels of FG richness. We observed a greater niche overlap with an increase of FGs, with species taking up greater proportion of15NO3-than15NH4+. Our results indicate that plant overyielding in wetland mesocosms is not the result of niche partitioning of N chemical forms, but is associated with greater uptake of NO3. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {The ecological niche is a multi-dimensional concept including aspects of resource use, environmental tolerance, and interspecific interactions, and the degree to which niches overlap is central to many ecological questions. Plant phenotypic traits are increasingly used as surrogates of species niches, but we lack an understanding of how key sampling decisions affect our ability to capture phenotypic differences among species. Using trait data of ecologically distinct monkeyflower (Mimulus) congeners, we employed linear discriminant analysis to determine how (1) dimensionality (the number and type of traits) and (2) variation within species influence how well measured traits reflect phenotypic differences among species. We conducted analyses using vegetative and floral traits in different combinations of up to 13 traits and compared the performance of commonly used functional traits such as specific leaf area against other morphological traits. We tested the importance of intraspecific variation by assessing how population choice changed our ability to discriminate species. Neither using key functional traits nor sampling across plant functions and organs maximized species discrimination. When using few traits, vegetative traits performed better than combinations of vegetative and floral traits or floral traits alone. Overall, including more traits increased our ability to detect phenotypic differences among species. Population choice and the number of traits used had comparable impacts on discriminating species. We addressed methodological challenges that have undermined cross-study comparability of trait-based approaches. Our results emphasize the importance of sampling among-population trait variation and suggest that a high-dimensional approach may best capture phenotypic variation among species with distinct niches.},

abstract = {Over the last 20 years, a change in traditional land use practices has taken place in central Germany. Formerly species-rich dry grassland communities have been converted into communities with greatly reduced diversity in many places. Whereas grass species have expanded, several forbs have declined in abundance. For the present study, plant-plant interactions were assessed between the expanding grass Festuca rupicola and the forb Dianthus carthusianorum - two typical, companion grassland species - to ascertain any associated effects of land use change. A competition experiment was set up with replacement design, in which pots were placed in the open field and monitored over two consecutive years. In order to assess the performance of both species in monoculture (D9, F9) and mixture (D3F6, D6F3) the parameters biomass, length of flowering stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers per individual, or length of panicles, were analyzed. Positive and negative interactions were evaluated using the "Relative Neighbour Effect" index (RNE). To simulate land use by grazing or mowing, individuals in half of the pots were clipped in the first year after sowing. At this time, performance of D. carthusianorum - in terms of length of flowering stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers - was significantly affected: whereas the first parameter increased, both of the other parameters decreased with increasing presence of the grass species. However, RNE indicated facilitation with a low number of F. rupicola individuals, and competition with a high number of F. rupicola individuals. In contrast, F. rupicola did not show any significant differences in performance with increasing presence of D. carthusianorum, and the RNE switched from neutral interaction to facilitation. In the second year after sowing, the performance of D. carthusianorum in the various treatments did not differ, except for the length of the flowering stems. The simulation of land use practices did not affect the performance of D. carthusianorum, but F. rupicola showed significant differences in biomass and in length of the panicles, as was the case also between monocultures and mixtures. The performance of the grass species was clearly improved in the unclipped treatments. The RNE reflected competition against D. carthusianorum which became reduced in unclipped treatments, while F. rupicola became facilitated. There were no interactions between the different treatments (monocultures and mixtures) and the simulated land use change (clipped and unclipped). Our data suggest that although traditional land use practices, i.e. grazing and mowing, do not affect the development of D. carthusianorum, the abandonment of these practices has improved F. rupicola performance, which has led to the increasingly invasive character of this grass species over the last 20 years. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Plant diversity was shown to influence the N cycle, but plant diversity effects on other nutrients remain unclear. We tested whether plant species richness or the presence/absence of particular functional plant groups influences P partitioning among differently extractable pools in soil, P concentrations in soil solution, and exploitation of P resources (i.e. the proportion of total bioavailable P in plants and soil that was stored in aboveground biomass) by the plant community in a 5-year biodiversity experiment in grassland.The experimental grassland site established in 2002 had 82 plots with different combinations of numbers of species (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 60) and functional groups (grasses, small non-leguminous herbs, tall non-leguminous herbs, legumes). In 2007, we determined P partitioning (Hedley) in soil of all experimental plots. We sampled plant community biomass and continuously extracted soil solution with suction plates from March 2003 to February 2007 and determined PO4-P concentrations in all samples.The presence of legumes increased aboveground P storage in plants and decreased labile Piconcentrations in soil because of their higher demands for P associated with N2fixation. During cold periods, readily plant-available PO4-P concentrations in soil solution increased in legume-containing mixtures likely caused by leaching from P-rich residues. We found a consistently positive effect of plant species richness on P exploitation by the plant community which was independent of the presence of particular plant functional groups. With proceeding time after establishment, plant species richness increasingly contributed to the explanation of the variance in P exploitation. Therefore, plant strategies to efficiently acquire P seem to become increasingly important in these grasslands. We conclude that diverse plant communities are better prepared than less diverse mixtures to respond to P limitation induced by continuously high atmospheric N deposition. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban gardens may support bees by providing resources in otherwise resource-poor environments. However, it is unclear whether urban, backyard gardens with native plants will support more bees than gardens without native plants. We examined backyard gardens in northwestern Ohio to ask: 1) Does bee diversity, abundance, and community composition differ in backyard gardens with and without native plants? 2)What characteristics of backyard gardens and land cover in the surrounding landscape correlate with changes in the bee community? 3) Do bees in backyard gardens respond more strongly to local or landscape factors? We sampled bees with pan trapping, netting, and direct observation. We examined vegetation characteristics and land cover in 500 m, 1 km, and 2 km buffers surrounding each garden. Abundance of all bees, native bees, and cavity-nesting bees (but not ground-nesting bees) was greater in native plant gardens but only richness of cavity-nesting bees differed in gardens with and without native plants. Bee community composition differed in gardens with and without native plants. Overall, bee richness and abundance were positively correlated with local characteristics of backyard gardens, such as increased floral abundance, taller vegetation, more cover by woody plants, less cover by grass, and larger vegetable gardens. Differences in the amount of forest, open space, and wetlands surrounding gardens influenced abundance of cavity- and ground-nesting bees, but at different spatial scales. Thus, presence of native plants, and local and landscape characteristics might play important roles in maintaining bee diversity within urban areas. Keywords},

abstract = {Aim In a selected literature survey we reviewed studies on the habitat heterogeneity–animal species diversity relationship and evaluated whether there are uncertainties and biases in its empirical support. Location World-wide. Methods We reviewed 85 publications for the period 1960–2003. We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study. Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to ‘keystone structures' that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

abstract = {Legume species promote productivity and increase the digestibility of herbage in grasslands. Considerable experimental data also indicate that communities with legumes produce more above-ground biomass than is expected from monocultures. While it has been attributed to N facilitation, evidence to identify the mechanisms involved is still lacking and the role of complementarity in soil water acquisition by vertical root differentiation remains unclear. We used a 20-months mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of species richness (single species, two- and five-species mixtures) and functional diversity (presence of the legume Trifolium repens) on a set of traits related to light, N and water use and measured at community level. We found a positive effect of Trifolium presence and abundance on biomass production and complementarity effects in the two-species mixtures from the second year. In addition the community traits related to water and N acquisition and use (leaf area, N, water- use efficiency, and deep root growth) were higher in the presence of Trifolium. With a multiple regression approach, we showed that the traits related to water acquisition and use were with N the main determinants of biomass production and complementarity effects in diverse mixtures. At shallow soil layers, lower root mass of Trifolium and higher soil moisture should increase soil water availability for the associated grass species. Conversely at deep soil layer, higher root growth and lower soil moisture mirror soil resource use increase of mixtures. Altogether, these results highlight N facilitation but almost soil vertical differentiation and thus complementarity for water acquisition and use in mixtures with Trifolium. Contrary to grass-Trifolium mixtures, no significant over- yielding was measured for grass mixtures even those having complementary traits (short and shallow vs. tall and deep). Thus, vertical complementarity for soil resources uptake in mixtures was not only dependant on the inherent root system architecture but also on root plasticity. We also observed a time-dependence for positive complementarity effects due to the slow development of Trifolium in mixtures, possibly induced by competition with grasses. Overall, our data underlined that soil water resource was an important driver of over-yielding and complementarity effects in Trifolium-grass mixtures.},

Two types of constructed wetlands, sub-surface (SSF) and free water surface (FWS) flow systems, and two more types of algae-based systems, high rate algae ponds (HRAP) and maturation pond (MP) have been studied for two years. All systems treated the same wastewater from a rural locality in Le{\'{o}}n (northwest of Spain). Hydraulic retention time was 3 days for both wetland systems, 20 days for the maturation pond and 10 days for the high rate algae pond.

A comparison among the wetland systems showed that SSF were more efficient than FWS system when considering surface removal rates (cfu removed/m2/d). Nevertheless, differences were not statistically significant. Considering mean removal efficiencies (in log unit), results showed that higher reductions were observed in FWS for most of the groups except for clostridia and Staphylococci. Concerning algae-based systems, MP showed higher removal efficiencies than HRAP, getting higher surface removal rates in the HRAP. Generally constructed wetlands were more efficient than algae-based systems when considering both, efficiencies in {\%} and surface removal rates. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract. Three common Appalachian plant species (Juncus effusus L., Scirpus validus L., and Typha latifolia L.) were planted into small-scale constructed wetlands receiving primary treated wastewater. The experimental design included two wetland gravel depths (45 and 60 cm) and five planting treatments (each species in monoculture, an equal mixture of the three species, and controls without vegetation), with two replicates per depth planting combination. Inflow rates (19 L day−1) and frequency (3 times day−1) were designed to simulate full-scale constructed wetlands as currently used for domestic wastewater treatment in West Virginia. Influent wastewater and the effluent from each wetland were sampled monthly for ten physical, chemical and biological parameters, and plant demographic measurements were made. After passing through these trough wetlands, the average of all treatments showed a 70{\%} reduction in total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 50 to 60{\%} reduction in nitrogen (TKN), ammonia and phosphate, and a reduction of fecal coliforms by three orders of magnitude. Depth of gravel (45 or 60 cm) had little effect on wetland treatment ability, but did influence Typha and Scirpus growth patterns. Gravel alone provided significant wastewater treatment, but vegetation further improved many treatment efficiencies. Typha significantly out-performed Juncus and Scirpus both in growth and in effluent quality improvement. There was also some evidence that the species mixture out-performed species monocultures. Typha was the superior competitor in mixtures, but a decline in Typha growth with distance from the influent pipe suggested that nutrients became limiting or toxicities may have developed.},

abstract = {Recent ecological research provides evidence that an increased number of plant species in natural grasslands is associated with increased biomass productivity, and provides a wide range of other ecosystem benefits. This suggests that increases in species diversity in agricultural ecosystems may similarly lead to increased benefits. The work reported below was part of the COST 852 Agrodiversity experiment, carried out at 34 sites across Europe. In Ireland, the effects of four-species grass-clover mixtures on herbage production, species persistence and unsown species suppression at three sites over multiple years, were investigated under growing conditions that were intensive relative to unfertilised natural grassland systems. The design included a range of four-species mixtures and monocultures of perennial ryegrass, timothy, cocksfoot, white clover, red clover and Caucasian clover. Several harvests were taken at each site for two or three years. Species diversity had a strong, persistent and positive effect on overall yield and the yield of sown species, and enhanced resistance to the growth of unsown species. Mixtures generally yielded well when compared with the best monoculture, and sometimes out yielded it. These effects on total yield declined over time but were still important at the end of the experiments. The diversity effects on sown species yield and on resistance to unsown species increased with time. Diversity effects were robust to changes in species composition, and persisted for the duration of the experiments across mixtures and over time. Virtually every mixture had a higher yield, and suppressed unsown species better, than monocultures of perennial ryegrass. These patterns were broadly consistent across sites. The persistence of species varied widely and was not consistent across sites.},

Substrate nitrate concentration significantly increased while ammonium concentration significantly decreased with the increase of plant SR (p?=?0.008 and 0.040, respectively). The response of ecosystem productivity to increasing SR was unimodal with four species per plot achieving the greatest productivity. Transgressive overyielding, which was compared to the most productive of corresponding monocultures, did not occur in most polycultures.

abstract = {There is increasing public, industry and government interest in establishing green roofs in Australian cities due to their demonstrated environmental benefits. While a small number of green roofs have been constructed in Australia, most are roof gardens or intensive green roofs. Despite their potential as a climate change adaptation and mitigation tool and their widespread use in the northern hemisphere, there are very few examples of extensive green roofs in Australia. One of the major barriers to increasing the prevalence of extensive green roofs in Australia is the lack of scientific data available to evaluate their applicability to local conditions. Relying on European and North American experience and technology is problematic due to significant differences in climate, available substrates and plants. This paper examines green roofs in Australia, discusses the challenges to increasing their use and the major information gaps that need to be researched to progress the industry in Australia. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow (HF CWs) have been used for wastewater treatment for more than 30 years. Most HF CWs have been designed to treat municipal or domestic wastewater. Nowadays, municipal HF CWs focus not only on common pollutants but also on special parameters such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptive chemicals or linear alkylbenzensulfonates (LAS). At present, HF CWs are used to treat many other types of wastewater. Industrial applications include wastewaters from oil refineries, chemical factories, pulp and paper production, tannery and textile industries, abattoir, distillery and winery industries. In particular, the use of HF CWs is becoming very common for treatment of food-processing wastewaters (e.g., production and processing of milk, cheese, potatoes, sugar). HF constructed wetlands are also successfully used to treat wastewaters from agriculture (e.g., pig and dairy farms, fish farm effluents) and various runoff waters (agriculture, airports, highway, greenhouses, plant nurseries). HF CWs have also effectively been used to treat landfill leachate. Besides the use as a single unit, HF CWs are also used in combination with other types of constructed wetlands in hybrid systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Complementarity and sampling effects may both contribute to increased invasion resistance at higher diversity. We measured plant invader biomass across a long-term experimental plant diversity gradient. Invader species biomass was inhibited in more diverse plots, largely because of the presence of strongly competitive C4 bunchgrasses, consistent with a sampling effect. Invader biomass was negatively correlated with resident root biomass, and positively correlated with soil nitrate concentrations, suggesting that competition for nitrogen limited invader success. Resident root biomass increased and soil nitrate concentrations decreased with the presence of C4 grasses and also across the diversity gradient, suggesting that diverse plots are more competitive because of the presence of C4 grasses. In addition to this evidence for a sampling effect, we also found evidence for a complementarity effect. Specifically, the percentage of plots that had lower invader biomass than did the best resident monoculture (i.e. that had invader underyielding) increased across the species richness gradient. This pattern cannot be explained by a sampling effect and is a unique signature of complementarity effects. Our results demonstrate the importance of multiple mechanisms by which diversity can increase invasion resistance.},

abstract = {Insect outbreaks in forest and agriculture monocultures led Charles Elton to propose, a half-century ago, that higher plant diversity stabilized animal foodweb dynamics in natural ecosystems. We tested this hypothesis by studying arthropod community dynamics in a long-term experimental manipulation of grassland plant species diversity. Over the course of a decade, we found that higher plant diversity increased the stability (i.e. lowered year-to-year variability) of a diverse ({\textgreater}700 species) arthropod community across trophic levels. As the number of plant species increased, the stability of both herbivore and predator species richness and of total herbivore abundance increased. The underlying mechanisms driving these diversity-stability relationships were plant diversity, via effects on primary productivity and plant community stability, and portfolio effects. Taken together, our results show that higher plant diversity provides more temporally consistent food and habitat resources to arthropod foodwebs. Consequently, actively managing for high plant diversity may have stronger than expected benefits for increasing animal diversity and controlling pest outbreaks.},

abstract = {1. Recent research has shown that biodiversity may have its greatest impact on ecosystem functioning in heterogeneous environments. However, the role of soil heterogeneity as a modulator of ecosystem responses to changes in biodiversity remains poorly understood, as few biodiversity studies have explicitly considered this important ecosystem feature. 2. We conducted a microcosm experiment over two growing seasons to evaluate the joint effects of changes in plant functional groups (grasses, legumes, non-legume forbs and a combination of them), spatial distribution of soil nutrients (homogeneous and heterogeneous) and nutrient availability (50 and 100 mg of nitrogen (N) added as organic material) on plant productivity and surrogates of carbon, phosphorous and N cycling (beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase enzymes and in situ N availability, respectively). 3. Soil nutrient heterogeneity interacted with nutrient availability and plant functional diversity to determine productivity and nutrient cycling responses. All the functional groups exhibited precise root foraging patterns. Above- and below-ground productivity increased under heterogeneous nutrient supply. Surrogates of nutrient cycling were not directly affected by soil nutrient heterogeneity. Regardless of their above- and below-ground biomass, legumes increased the availability of soil inorganic N and the activity of the acid phosphatase and P-glucosidase enzymes. 4. Our study emphasizes the role of soil nutrient heterogeneity as a modulator of ecosystem responses to changes in functional diversity beyond the species level. Functional group identity, rather than richness, can play a key role in determining the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. 5. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly considering soil heterogeneity in diversity-ecosystem functioning experiments, where the identity of the plant functional group is of major importance. Such consideration will improve our ability to fully understand the role of plant diversity on ecosystem functioning in ubiquitous heterogeneous environments.},

abstract = {The variability of bee communities along an urban gradient has a potentially strong impact on pollinator- plant interactions. We investigated changes in bee species richness and community composition in the city centre and suburbs of Poznan´, Poland. During 2006–2008 we recorded 2,495 individuals from 104 species. The most abundant species was Andrena haemmorhoa. Other abundant species were Bombus pascuorum, Andrena vaga, Andrena nitida, Bombus terrestris. Several species appeared to be more abundant in the city centre whereas others showed an opposite tendency. We have found that the urbanized landscape can act as a filter for the bee community since some specific ecological traits facilitate colonization of the city centre. Small-bodied species that start their activity later in the season and are not solitary preferred the city centre. However, bee species diversity and richness remained stable across the urban gradient indicating some advantages of being a city dwelling bee. We suggest that a city can be a very important habitat for a diverse bee fauna and that conservation of a wide range of habitats of different urbanization levels seems to be the most suitable strategy for conservation of bee diversity in cities.},

abstract = {The efficiency by which communities capture limiting resources may be related to the number of species or functional types competing therein. This is because species use different resources (i.e. complementarity effect) or because species-rich communities include species with extreme functional traits (positive selection effect). We conducted two manipulative studies to separate the effects of functional richness and functional identity on the feeding efficiency (i.e. filtration rate) of suspension-feeding invertebrates growing on vertical surfaces. In addition, one experiment tested whether the density of organisms influences the effect of functional diversity. Monocultures and complete mixtures of functional types were fed with a solution of microalgae of different sizes (6 $\mu$m-40 $\mu$m). Experiments conducted at two locations, Helgoland and Plymouth, showed that functional identity had far larger effects on filtration rate than richness. Mixtures did not outperform the average monoculture or the best-performing monoculture and this pattern was independent on density. The high efficiency of one of the functional types in consuming most microalgae could have minimised the resource complementarity. The loss or gain of particular species may therefore have a stronger impact on the functioning of epibenthic communities than richness per se. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {For centuries, traditional agricultural systems have contributed to food and livelihood security throughout the world. Recognizing the ecological legacy in the traditional agricultural systems may help us develop novel sustainable agriculture. We examine how rice-fish coculture (RF), which has been designated a "globally important agricultural heritage system," has been maintained for over 1,200 y in south China. A field survey demonstrated that although rice yield and rice-yield stability are similar in RF and rice monoculture (RM), RF requires 68{\%} less pesticide and 24{\%} less chemical fertilizer than RM. A field experiment confirmed this result. We documented that a mutually beneficial relationship between rice and fish develops in RF: Fish reduce rice pests and rice favors fish by moderating the water environment. This positive relationship between rice and fish reduces the need for pesticides in RF. Our results also indicate a complementary use of nitrogen (N) between rice and fish in RF, resulting in low N fertilizer application and low N release into the environment. These findings provide unique insights into how positive interactions and complementary use of resource between species generate emergent ecosystem properties and how modern agricultural systems might be improved by exploiting synergies between species.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity (PD) describes the total amount of phylogenetic distance among species in a community. Although there has been substantial research on the factors that determine community PD, exploration of the consequences of PD for ecosystem functioning is just beginning. We argue that PD may be useful in predicting ecosystem functions in a range of communities, from single-trophic to complex networks. Many traits show a phylogenetic signal, suggesting that PD can estimate the functional trait space of a community, and thus ecosystem functioning. Phylogeny also determines interactions among species, and so could help predict how extinctions cascade through ecological networks and thus impact ecosystem functions. Although the initial evidence available suggests patterns consistent with these predictions, we caution that the utility of PD depends critically on the strength of phylogenetic signals to both traits and interactions. We advocate for a synthetic approach that incorporates a deeper understanding of how traits and interactions are shaped by evolution, and outline key areas for future research. If these complexities can be incorporated into future studies, relationships between PD and ecosystem function bear promise in conceptually unifying evolutionary biology with ecosystem ecology.},

abstract = {The idea that plant communities with high species diversity are more stable, productive, and resistant to invasion at small spatial scales has become an important ecological paradigm. Recently, the role of soil biota has emerged as a major driver of this relationship between plant species diversity and ecosystem function. In greenhouse experiments, we found that soil collected from experimentally constructed species-rich plant assemblages (that originally contained between 10 and 16 species) promoted the growth of 4 native target plant species more than soil from species-poor communities (that originally contained between 2 and 5 species). Sterilization of soils from species-poor communities improved the growth of these target species more than sterilization of soils from species-rich plant communities, indicative that inhibitory soil biota had greater negative impacts on plant growth in low versus high diversity soils. These results suggest that strong soil biota effects in soils do not simply accrue in experimental monocultures, but can occur in low diversity assemblages that are more realistic of what occurs in nature. Our findings suggest a mechanistic explanation for the diversity–productivity relationship, and further support the importance of inhibitory soil biota as significant contributors to spatial and temporal patterns of abundance in natural plant communities through negative plant−soil feedback.},

abstract = {The promotion of green roofs for their wider value for biodiversity has received great attention recently. Indeed, in a number of European cities, the main driver for implementation of green roofs is their habitat value, particularly where development on the ground is destroying or threatening protected or rare wildlife sites. A particular approach has developed that has lead to certain types of green roof being referred to as „biodiversity roofs‟, and a set of rules has emerged (closely related to concepts of restoration ecology) that typify an approach that is good for biodiversity. This paper reviews some of these rules or assumptions, using the latest scientific evidence, and evaluates their direct application to the green roof context. Specific aspects covered include: the use of native plant species only (assumed to be better fitted than non-natives to regional climates, and to support a wider range of other life than non-native plants); the use of locally-characteristic plant communities (assumed to provide local distinctiveness, and again because such communities are better fitted to local conditions); the use of local-provenance material and local ecotypes (assumed to preserve local genetic diversity and locally adapted populations); and the use of local soils and substrates (assumed to be better fitted to local conditions, to best support local vegetation, and to have lower „embodied energy‟ than other substrates). Many of these assumptions do not hold true in pure ecological terms, but they are highly beneficial in creating distinctive green roofs that reflect local conditions. Finally, the author sets out a framework that considers aesthetic as well as scientific criteria when designing green roofs for biodiversity.},

The focus is on plants, which are major components of these systems, and for which the functional approach has led to major scientific advances over the last 20 years. Plant Functional Diversity presents the rationale for a trait-based approach to functional diversity in the context of comparative plant ecology and agroecology. It demonstrates how this approach can be used to address a number of highly debated questions in plant ecology pertaining to plant responses to their environment, controls on plant community structure, ecosystem properties, and the services these deliver to human societies.

abstract = {The relationship between biological diversity and ecological stability has fascinated ecologists for decades. Determining the generality of this relationship, and discovering the mechanisms that underlie it, are vitally important for ecosystem management. Here, we investigate how species richness affects the temporal stability of biomass production by reanalyzing 27 recent biodiversity experiments conducted with primary producers. We find that, in grasslands, increasing species richness stabilizes whole-community biomass but destabilizes the dynamics of constituent populations. Community biomass is stabilized because species richness impacts mean biomass more strongly than its variance. In algal communities, species richness has a minimal effect on community stability because richness affects the mean and variance of biomass nearly equally. Using a new measure of synchrony among species, we find that for both grasslands and algae, temporal correlations in species biomass are lower when species are grown together in polyculture than when grown alone in monoculture. These results suggest that interspecific interactions tend to stabilize community biomass in diverse communities. Contrary to prevailing theory, we found no evidence that species' responses to environmental variation in monoculture predicted the strength of diversity's stabilizing effect. Together, these results deepen our understanding of when and why increasing species richness stabilizes community biomass.},

We note three primary approaches to integrating phylogenetic information into studies of community organization: 1. examining the phylogenetic structure of community assemblages, 2. exploring the phylogenetic basis of community niche structure, and 3. adding a community context to studies of trait evolution and biogeography. We recognize a common pattern of phy- logenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emer- gent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, charac- ter reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these ar- eas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Tree diversity is an important driver of forest ecosystem functioning, hypothesised to enhance tree growth and resistance to herbivores. To test this, we assessed the relative importance of tree species richness and functional diversity on tree height growth and insect herbivore damage across three tree diversity experiments in Finland, France and Germany, established within the last fifteen years. These experiments encompass species richness gradients from monocultures up to five species mixtures, with compositions drawn from a pool of eleven tree species. Tree height growth and total insect herbivory were evaluated at both the tree species and forest plot scales. Trees in mixtures tended to grow taller, but on average received more insect herbivory relative to monocultures. Gradients of tree species richness or functional diversity had only weak impact on the magnitude of these effects. Community weighted means of specific leaf area alone captured diversity effects on tree height growth, with stronger positive effects of diversity in mixtures with high community SLA. Tree species-specific responses were highly variable. No species significantly benefited both in terms of increased growth and reduced herbivory when grown in mixtures. More species showed positive height growth responses in mixed assemblages, but only the two exotic conifers experienced associational resistance to herbivores. This large-scale study shows that tree height growth in young forest plantations tends to be higher in species mixtures than in monocultures, but incremental increases in functional diversity have, at best, weak marginal growth benefits. Moreover, there appear to be contrasting effects at forest plot versus individual species scales. Thus, while some species show lower herbivore damage in mixtures, this is not a consistent trend and contrasts the higher overall damage in mixtures observed at the forest plot scale. To improve both tree growth and resistance to herbivores in tree species mixtures seems therefore challenging.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that encourage or inhibit plant invasions is vital to focusing limited invasive control efforts within areas where they are most practical and cost-effective. To extend the range of contexts in which invasibility is studied and aid the development of practical strategies to limit damaging plant invasions, we set out to test the relative importance of native species richness, native seedling density, and invasive propagule pressure, on the invasibility of artificial assemblages of naturally occurring tropical woody seedling communities. Our greenhouse mesocosms included a species pool of twelve trees and woody shrubs native to South Florida's tropical hardwood hammocks, and an increasingly prevalent noxious woody invader of this system, Ardisia elliptica. We found that invader propagule pressure was the single most important factor determining community invasibility. We also revealed a positive relationship between invasibility and native species richness in our polyculture mesocosms. Because A. elliptica biomass production significantly differed among different native monocultures and was not related to overyielding in native polycultures, we suggest that the effect of species richness on invasibility in this experiment was the result of sampling effects rather than a true effect of diversity.Three broad findings hold potential for application in preventing and controlling plant invasions, especially in the seedling layers of tropical dry forests: (1) effective invasive control efforts will likely benefit from measures to minimize propagule pressure; (2) managers might do well to prioritize invasive monitoring and removal efforts on the most diverse habitats within a management region; and (3) while more data are necessary to further understand our finding of a lack of association between productivity and invasibility, management regimes aimed at maximizing primary productivity might not increase invasibility, and in fact, strategies for controlling invasive plants via the management of ecosystem productivity may be ineffective. {\textcopyright} 2013 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

abstract = {Raingardens capture and filter urban stormwater using sandy soils and drought-tolerant plants. An emerging question is whether raingardens can also be used as vegetable gardens, potentially increasing their popularity and implementation. A successful vegetable raingarden will need to both retain stormwater and produce vegetables, despite potential water deficits between rainfall events. To determine whether raingardens can provide this dual functionality, we undertook a greenhouse pot experiment using two different substrates (loamy sand raingarden substrate and potting mix typical of containerised vegetable growing) and two methods of stormwater application (‘sub-surface' and ‘surface' watering) with the water quantity at each application determined by average Melbourne summer rainfall. Overall, potting mix produced bigger plants (biomass and leaf area) and greater yield than did the loamy sand. Yield effects were variable: tomato yield was unaffected by treatment, bean yield was greatest in potting mix, beetroot yield was greatest with sub-surface watering and parsley yield was greatest with surface watering. Bigger plants also had greater transpiration, which meant that stormwater retention was greatest for parsley and tomato plants growing in potting mix with surface watering. Although, a raingarden with potting mix and surface application of stormwater was optimal for producing food and retaining stormwater under our rainfall regime, potting mix could be problematic due to higher nutrient leaching and breakdown over time. Therefore, we recommend using a mix of loamy sand and potting mix. However, the choice of substrate and watering treatment require trade-offs between yield, stormwater retention and potential implications for water quality and long-term stability of hydraulic properties.},

abstract = {Increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces is a major concern in urban areas and green roofs are increasingly used as an innovative means of stormwater management. However, there are very few studies on how different vegetation types affect the amount of water runoff. This paper describes an experiment that investigates the influence of plant species and plant diversity on the amount of water runoff from a simulated green roof. Twelve species were selected from the three major taxonomic and functional plant groups that are commonly used for extensive green roofs (forbs, sedum and grasses). Four species were chosen from each group and planted in combinations of increasing diversity and complexity: monocultures, four-species mixtures and twelve-species mixtures. The results showed that there was a significant difference in amount of water runoff between vegetation types; grasses were the most effective for reducing water runoff, followed by forbs and sedum. It was also shown that the size and structure of plants significantly influenced the amount of water runoff. Plant species with taller height, larger diameter, and larger shoot and root biomass were more effective in reducing water runoff from simulated green roofs than plant species with shorter height, smaller diameter, and smaller shoot and root biomass. The amount of water runoff from Sedum spp. was higher than that from bare ground. Species richness did not affect the amount of water runoff in this study.},

We hypothesized that mixtures with more equal proportions of species in the seed mixture (i.e., greater species evenness) would have greater productivity and fewer weeds than mixtures dominated by one or two species or monocultures. Two experiments with 15 mixtures and monocultures of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), quackgrass (Elytrigia repens L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) (Exp. 1) or 15 mixtures and monocultures of meadow fescue [Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P. Beauv.], reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), red clover (T. pratense L.), and kura clover (T. ambiguum L.) (Exp. 2) were sown in autumn 2008 at four locations in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In each experiment, there were four monocultures, four mixtures dominated by one species, six mixtures dominated by pairs of species, and one equal mixture. Mixtures and monocultures were harvested four to five times each year from 2009 to 2011. Mixtures often had more biomass than the average of legume or N-fertilized grass monocultures. Mixtures with more equal proportions of species in the seed mixture, however, did not have more biomass or fewer weeds than other mixtures. Rather, differences in yield were related to the dominant species in the mixture. Optimal legume percentages (30-40{\%}) in the harvested biomass were achieved with a wide range of grass and legume seed proportions, which suggested that farmers have wide flexibility in formulating seed mixtures for pastures.},

The rubber trees and coffee crop were planted in the East/West direction, in Jaguar{\'{e}}, Esp{\'{i}}rito Santo, Brazil. Was evaluated the luminosity, temperature and relative humidity, leaf nutrient concentrations; internodes of the plagiotropic and orthotropic branches, leaf area; relative chlorophyll index, and tree yield of the coffee crops. The shading directly influenced the microclimate by reducing the air temperature in the summer and winter, as well as by increasing relative humidity. Luminosity in the summer had an average decrease of 905 lumens ft-2 throughout the day, which was equivalent to 72.49{\%}, and luminosity in the winter had an average decrease of 1665 lumens ft-2, which was equivalent to 88.04{\%}. The shading provided greater etiolation of the plagiotropic and orthotropic branches as well as greater leaf expansion as compared to the full sun. The leaf concentration of Fe and Mn were higher in the shaded coffee. Estimated chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were greater in the coffee crop grown at under full sun. The dense shading produced by rubber trees provided losses in the coffee crop yield, however, there is the formation of the rubber tree.},

Services offered by invertebrates in these novel environments include pollina- tion for plant reproduction and yield in cultivated crops, pest control to reduce damage to green roof vegetation, decomposition to retain organic matter and cycle nutrients in the substrate, and contribution to food webs for species like birds that frequent green roofs. Although we may assume that beneficial invertebrates are desirable on green roofs, it is not clear whether they adequately provide habi- tat or not. Green roof design can vary, as can their suitability as habitat, some supporting almost no species and others meeting both the foraging and nesting requirements of many. When designers in- clude plant, substrate and other microhabitat conditions to support certain at-risk species or functionally important groups, green roofs may act as analog habitat where it is limited at ground level. Green roofs are uniquely isolated and exposed to sun and wind and their relative value will ultimately depend on the invertebrate taxa in question. If green roofs are to support invertebrate communities, elucidating habitat requirements and monitoring wildlife design suc- cesses are as essential as public outreach that encourages urban bio- diversity conservation.},

abstract = {Aims Root tissue density (RTD, the ratio of root dry mass to root volume) is a fundamental trait in compara- tive root ecology, being increasingly used as an indicator of plant species' resource use strategy. However, the lack of standardized method to measure this trait makes com- parisons tricky. This study aims to compare three methods commonly used for determining fine RTD and to test whether root dry matter content (RDMC, the ratio between root drymass and root freshmass) could be used as a surrogate of fine root tissue density. Methods RTD of 163 fine root samples was determined using (i) Archimedes' method, (ii) image analysis (WinRHIZO software), and (iii) using the root dry matter content as a proxy. Root samples belonged to different herbaceous species grown in different conditions. Results RTD measured with Archimedes' method was positively correlated with RTD estimated with image analysis and with RDMC. However we demonstrated that RTD measured with Archimedes' method was better predicted by RDMC (R2=0.90) than by RTD measured with image analysis (R2=0.56). The perfor- mance and limitations of each method were discussed. Conclusion RDMCis a quick, cheap and relatively easy measurable root attribute; we thus recommended its measurement as a proxy of fine root tissue density.},

abstract = {Belowground interactions in diverse plant communities may be decisive for the performance of individual species and community stability. Here we assessed the effect of tree species richness on belowground fine-root morphology and belowground competition between four different species in a 6-year-old field biodiversity experiment to test the hypotheses: (i) overall fine-root exploitation (total fine-root length and surface area) increases with tree species richness; (ii) belowground interspecific competition is size-symmetric.Overall fine-root length and surface area in the centre of neighbourhoods of four saplings were initially low (1.03kmm-2and 2.00m2m-2), but reached 3.13kmm-2and 6.50 m2m-2, respectively, across all species combinations after two growing seasons in the ingrowth cores. However, no significant differences were found among the different tree species richness levels. The saplings of different tree species grew in proportion to their initial sizes with respect to aboveground basal area increments. For belowground fine-root growth in mixed neighbourhoods, however, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea abies had higher fine-root growth rates in ingrowth cores than in monocultures, whereas the reverse was true for Fagus sylvatica and Quercus petraea. After two years of root ingrowth, the competitive ability indexes (P. abies=0.07, P. menziesii=0.08, F. sylvatica=-0.19, Q. petraea=-0.18) revealed that belowground competition in this sapling stand was size-asymmetric and that conifers showed a higher competitive ability, when fine-root growth was related to aboveground standing basal area. Nutrient enrichment in ingrowth cores did not affect proliferation rates and morphology of fine roots significantly. Fine-root morphologies of different species were remarkably different, but within each species the morphology was not significantly influenced by tree species richness of neighbourhoods. Our results show that belowground competition may occur earlier than aboveground in mixed forest stands and fine-root growth of dominant species benefitted more from mixing with other species than that of inferior species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Climate change is projected to increase the frequency of extreme events, such as flooding and droughts, which are anticipated to have negative effects on the biodiversity of primary producers and consequently the associated consumer communities. Here we assessed the effects of an extreme early summer flooding event in 2013 on ant colonies along an experimental gradient of plant species richness in a temperate grassland. We tested the effects of flood duration, plant species richness, plant cover, soil temperature, and soil porosity on ant occurrence and abundance. We found that the ant community was dominated by Lasius niger, whose presence and abundance after the flood was not significantly affected by any of the tested variables, including plant species richness. We found the same level of occupation by L. niger at the field site after the flood (surveyed in 2013) as before the flood (surveyed in 2006). Thus, there were no negative effects of the flood on the presence of L. niger in the plots. We can exclude recolonisation as a possible explanation of ant presence in the field site due to the short time period between the end of the flood and survey as well as to the absence of a spatial pattern in the occupancy data. Thus, the omnipresence of this dominant ant species 1 month after the flood indicates that the colonies were able to survive a 3-week summer flood. The observed ant species proved to be flood resistant despite experiencing such extreme climatic events very rarely.},

abstract = {Recent declines of bee species have led to great interest in preserving and promoting bee populations for agricultural and wild plant pollination. Many correlational studies have examined the indirect effects of factors such as landscape context and land management practices and found great variation in bee response. We focus here on the evidence for effects of direct factors (i.e., food resources, nesting resources, and incidental risks) regulating bee populations and then interpret varied responses to indirect factors through their species-specific and habitat-specific effects on direct factors. We find strong evidence for food resource availability regulating bee populations, but little clear evidence that other direct factors are commonly limiting. We recommend manipulative experiments to illuminate the effects of these different factors. We contend that much of the variation in impact from indirect factors, such as grazing, can be explained by the relationships between indirect factors and floral resource availability based on environmental circumstances.},

abstract = {The prediction of pest-control functioning by multi-predator communities is hindered by the non-additive nature of species functioning. Such non-additivity, commonly termed an emergent multi-predator effect, is known to be affected by elements of the ecological context, such as the structure and composition of vegetation, in addition to the traits of the predators themselves. Here we report mesocosm experiments designed to test the influence of plant density and species composition (wheat monoculture or wheat and faba bean polyculture) on the emergence of multi-predator effects between Adalia bipunctata and Chrysoperla carnea, in their suppression of populations of the aphid Metopolophium dirhodum. The mesocosm experiments were followed by a series of behavioural observations designed to identify how interactions among predators are modified by plant species composition and whether these effects are consistent with the observed influence of plant species composition on aphid population suppression. Although plant density was shown to have no influence on the multi-predator effect on aphid population growth, plant composition had a marked effect. In wheat monoculture, Adalia and Chrysoperla mixed treatments caused greater suppression of M. dirhodum populations than expected. However this positive emergent effect was reversed to a negative multi-predator effect in wheat and faba bean polyculture. The behavioural observations revealed that although dominant individuals did not respond to the presence of faba bean plants, the behaviour of sub-dominants was affected markedly, consistent with their foraging for extra-floral nectar produced by the faba bean. This interaction between plant composition and predator community composition on the foraging behaviour of sub-dominants is thought to underlie the observed effect of plant composition on the multi-predator effect. Thus, the emergence of multi-predator effects is shown to be strongly influenced by plant species composition, mediated, in this case, by the provision of extra-floral nectar by one of the plant species.},

abstract = {Farms in the glaciated tallgrass prairie region of North America are topographically heterogeneous with wide-ranging soil quality. This environmental heterogeneity may affect choice and placement of species planted for biomass production. We designed replicated experiments and monitored farm-scale production to evaluate the effects of landscape position, vegetation type, and year on yields of monocultures and mixtures. Research was conducted on a 262-ha South Dakota working farm where cropland had been replanted with a variety of native grassland types having biofuel feedstock potential. Vegetation type (diverse mixture or switchgrass [Panicum virgatum L.] monoculture) and year interacted to influence yield in replicated experiments (p{\textless}0.10). Mean annual switchgrass yield above a stubble height of 10cm was 9.3Mgha-1 in two replicated experiments, and was greater than yield of mixtures (7.3Mgha-1) in 6 of 7 year??vegetation type combinations. Landscape position interacted with year and vegetation type to influence yield (p{\textless}0.10). Variability was generally greatest at the lowest landscape position. On the farm's larger fields (0.4-46ha), three-year mean yields of switchgrass monocultures cut at ground level (12.7Mgha-1) were also greater than yields of mixtures (9.7Mgha-1) but both were less than prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link) monoculture yield (13.2Mgha-1) in a restored wetland. A combination of prairie monocultures and mixtures, strategically placed across a farm landscape, could offer a balance of productivity, ecosystem services, and income with potential as biofuel feedstock and other income streams (hay, seed, beef). ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, these created ecosystems also provide a range of other benefits, or ecosystem services, which are often acknowledged but rarely quantified. In this study, additional ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and cultural services, were assessed and compared between 20 ponds and 20 CSWs in North Carolina, USA. Carbon sequestration was estimated through the carbon content of pond and wetland sediments across a gradient of system age. Biodiversity was quantified in terms of the richness and Shannon diversity index of vegetative and aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Cultural services were qualitatively assessed based on the potential for recreational and educational opportunities at each site. Ponds and wetlands were found to support similar levels of macroinvertebrate diversity, though differences community composition arose between the two habitat types. CSWs demonstrated greater potential to provide carbon sequestration, vegetative diversity, and cultural ecosystem services. This assessment provides an initial framework upon which future assessments of ecosystem service provision by SCMs can build. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper reports the findings of a short-term natural invasibility field study in constructed Mediterranean herbaceous communities of varying diversities, under a fire treatment. Three components of invasibility, i.e. species richness, density and biomass of invaders, have been monitored in burnt and unburnt experimental plots with resident diversity ranging from monocultures to 18-species mixtures. In general, species richness, density and biomass of invaders decreased significantly with the increase of resident species richness. Furthermore, the density and biomass of invading species were significantly influenced by the species composition of resident communities. Although aboveground biomass, leaf area index, canopy height and percent bare ground of the resident communities explained a significant part of the variation in the success of invading species, these covariates did not fully explain the effects of resident species richness. Fire mainly influenced invasibility via soil nutrient levels. The effect of fire on observed invasibility patterns seems to be less important than the effects of resident species richness. Our results demonstrate the importance of species richness and composition in controlling the initial stages of plant invasions in Mediterranean grasslands but that there was a lack of interaction with the effects of fire disturbance.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society.Numerous studies have demonstrated biodiversity-productivity relationships in plant communities, and analogous genetic diversity-productivity studies using genotype mixtures of single species may show similar patterns. Alternatively, competing individuals among genotypes within a species are less likely to exhibit resource-use complementarity, even when they exhibit large differences in their effects on ecosystem function. In this study, we test the impact of genotype diversity and genetic identity on ecosystem function using an ecosystem-scale common garden experiment. Distinct tree genotypes were collected across the entire natural range of the riparian tree Populus fremontii in the USA, and grown in 1-16 genotype combination forest stands. Due to the warm climate and irrigation of the planting location along the Colorado River (AZ, USA), mature forest physiognomy with trees up to 19 m tall was achieved in just five years. Several key patterns emerged: (i) genotype richness did not predict forest productivity, suggesting a lack of net biodiversity effects; (ii) we found differences among genotype monoculture stands comparable to differences in average productivity across all forest biomes on Earth; (iii) productivity was predicted based on genetic marker similarity in trees; (iv) genetic-based differences in leaf phenology (early leaf-on and late leaf-fall timing) were correlated with {\textgreater}80{\%} of the variation in tree and forest productivity irrespective of home-site conditions. Large differences in productivity among genotypes can result in dramatic differences in forest productivity without resulting in diversity-productivity relationships that are present in species-scale biodiversity studies.},

abstract = {Habitat loss from urban development threatens native plant populations in many regions of the world. In addition to direct plant mortality, urban intensification potentially impacts pollinator communities and in turn disrupts the pollination mutualisms that are critical to the viability of native plant populations. We placed standardized flowering plant arrays into woodlands along a gradient of increasing urban land use to simultaneously quantify landscape-scale and local-scale effects on pollinators and on reproduction of two spring ephemeral wildflowers (Claytonia virginica and Polemonium reptans) in woodland fragments in the Mid-Atlantic Region of North America. Greater pollinator abundance and associated diversity significantly reduced the degree of pollen limitation, demonstrating that pollinator populations are critical to successful pollination of these plant populations. However, landscape-scale habitat loss did not reduce pollinator abundance or diversity. Habitat loss at the landscape scale therefore does not appear to drive changes in pollination in this woodland system. Rather, local-scale habitat characteristics were more important, with pollinators being more abundant in brighter woodland patches for one plant species, and in larger patches for the other species. Because we found abundant pollinators and adequate pollination even in isolated, urban woodland fragments, our results are encouraging for the conservation of both plants and pollinators in urban landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

After studying the natural habitat of coastal areas in Izu peninsula, a germination and cutting transplant study was carried out using herbaceous plants from the Jogasaki sea coast. Many plant species did not germinate at all and the use of cuttings was a better method than direct seeding. The green roof was installed in the spring of 2012 in Chiba city. Thirteen plant species from the Jogasaki sea coast, which were successfully propagated, were planted in three kinds of substrate (15 cm depth): pumice, roof tile and commercial green roof substrate. The water drainage was restricted and a reservoir with 5 cm depth of water underlaid the substrate to simulate a similar growing environment to the sea coast. Volcanic rocks were placed as mulch to create a landscape similar to that on the Jogasaki sea coast. Plant coverage on the green roof was measured every month from June 2012 to October 2014. All plants were harvested and their dry shoot weight was measured in December 2014. The type of substrate did not cause significant differences in plant survival and dry shoot weight. Sea coast plant species were divided into four categories: vigorous growth; seasonal change; disappearing after a few years; limited growth. Understanding the ecology of natural habitats was important to simulating a local landscape using native plant communities on the green roof.},

abstract = {Understory herbs and soil invertebrates play key roles in soil formation and nutrient cycling in forests. Studies suggest that diversity in the canopy and in the understory are positively associated, but these studies often confound the effects of tree species diversity with those of tree species identity and abiotic conditions. We combined extensive field sampling with structural equation modeling to evaluate the simultaneous effects of tree diversity on the species diversity of understory herbs, beetles, and earthworms. The diversity of earthworms and saproxylic beetles was directly and positively associated with tree diversity, presumably because species of both these taxa specialize on certain species of trees. Tree identity also strongly affected diversity in the understory, especially for herbs, likely as a result of interspecific differences in canopy light transmittance or litter decomposition rates. Our results suggest that changes in forest management will disproportionately affect certain understory taxa. For instance, changes in canopy diversity will affect the diversity of earthworms and saproxylic beetles more than changes in tree species composition, whereas the converse would be expected for understory herbs and detritivorous beetles. We conclude that the effects of tree diversity on understory taxa can vary from positive to negative and may affect biogeochemical cycling in temperate forests. Thus, maintaining high diversity in temperate forests can promote the diversity of multiple taxa in the understory.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: During their domestication, maize, bean and squash evolved in polycultures grown by small-scale farmers in the Americas. Polycultures often overyield on low-fertility soils, which are a primary production constraint in low-input agriculture. We hypothesized that root architectural differences among these crops causes niche complementarity and thereby greater nutrient acquisition than corresponding monocultures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A functional-structural plant model, SimRoot, was used to simulate the first 40 d of growth of these crops in monoculture and polyculture and to determine the effects of root competition on nutrient uptake and biomass production of each plant on low-nitrogen, -phosphorus and -potassium soils.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Squash, the earliest domesticated crop, was most sensitive to low soil fertility, while bean, the most recently domesticated crop, was least sensitive to low soil fertility. Nitrate uptake and biomass production were up to 7 {\%} greater in the polycultures than in the monocultures, but only when root architecture was taken into account. Enhanced nitrogen capture in polycultures was independent of nitrogen fixation by bean. Root competition had negligible effects on phosphorus or potassium uptake or biomass production.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that spatial niche differentiation caused by differences in root architecture allows polycultures to overyield when plants are competing for mobile soil resources. However, direct competition for immobile resources might be negligible in agricultural systems. Interspecies root spacing may also be too large to allow maize to benefit from root exudates of bean or squash. Above-ground competition for light, however, may have strong feedbacks on root foraging for immobile nutrients, which may increase cereal growth more than it will decrease the growth of the other crops. We note that the order of domestication of crops correlates with increasing nutrient efficiency, rather than production potential.},

abstract = {Recent research has indicated that increasing species diversity of the pastures might improve sward productivity and stability. The present experiment evaluates the effect of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Weber) as a potential pasture species on the performance of a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)-white clover (Trifolium repens L.) mixture in terms of total herbage yield, weed infestation, and nitrogen (N) yield in a replacement-series experiment over three harvest years. The three species were grown in monocultures and in all possible binary and three-species mixtures under two N fertilization levels (0 and 200 kg N ha(-1)). Herbage yield and N yield of the three-species mixture were not significantly different from the ryegrass-white clover mixture over the 3 yr. The contribution of dandelion to the total herbage yield increased over years, which improved yield stability. A competition analysis, performed by calculating relative yield and relative yield total, indicated that ryegrass had a competitive advantage over white clover in fertilized and unfertilized swards, but over dandelion only when the sward was fertilized. Nitrogen application reduced the nonsown species yield in all mixtures, except that of white clover-dandelion. Our results indicate that dandelion might have the potential of contributing to herbage yield, nutritive value, and resistance to invasions of ryegrass-white clover pastures.},

abstract = {For seven years, village-based recorders monitored fish catches and water levels in seven floodplain-associated lakes of the Lower Rufiji, Tanzania. The lakes differ in the number of days and volume of inflows from the river, and thus provide a natural experiment to explore the links between catch composition, income per hour of fishing (IPHF) and hydrological connectivity, and to analyse the response of the users. The fishers adapt their fishing mode and equipment to achieve a rather constant IPHF of between 0.2 and 0.8 US{\$}/fisher/hour. In situations of low connectivity, during a series of drought years, the less well-connected lakes lost many species and became a virtual monoculture of Oreochromis urolepis. Only in one extreme case was average fish size significantly reduced, indicating a high fishing pressure. Catch was therefore highly resilient to shifts toward illegal, non-selective and active fishing techniques. Fish diversity and lake productivity were quickly re-established when the larger lakes reconnected. The potential impacts of changes in the flood hydrograph (through dams, increased abstraction or climate/land-use changes) are assessed, and management options discussed.{\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright 2011 IAHS Press.},

abstract = {1. Niche differentiation is widely thought to promote both coexistence of many species within a trophic level, and higher total biomass of those species. However, the joint effects of changes in diversity within multiple trophic levels are unknown. The potential for niche differences to promote high diversity and biomass within a trophic level may depend on the diversity and composition of adjacent trophic levels. 2. Using a simple mechanistic model, I examine the joint consequences of changes in diversity on two adjacent trophic levels (‘predators' and ‘prey') for the total biomass of prey. Niche differences among prey reflect a trade-off between ability to compete for resources and ability to avoid/sustain predation. Niche differences among predators reflect differences in ability to consume different prey species. 3. Total prey biomass is a complex, joint function of prey and predator diversity. In particular, transgressive overyielding (when a diverse polyculture of prey outperforms any prey monoculture) can occur for some parameter values when a specialist predator mediates prey coexistence, and for a different set of parameter values when a specialist and a generalist predator together mediate prey coexistence, but is impossible when a generalist predator alone mediates prey coexistence. 4. Increased initial predator diversity tends to reduce total prey biomass even when predators cannot coexist, due to a ‘selection' effect for the most effective predator. Predators coexist only in prey polycultures. Coexisting predators can, but do not necessarily, reduce total prey biomass to a lower level than could any predator alone. 5. The niche differences that permit coexistence strongly constrain the rank order of total prey biomass across all prey and predator combinations. Knowledge of the key trade-offs that promote coexistence within food webs can allow powerful qualitative predictions of the effects of species loss on ecosystem-level properties such as total biomass.},

abstract = {Cover crop mixtures with complementary plant functional traits including biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) may supply nitrogen (N) to farm fields while simultaneously providing other ecosystem functions such as N retention and weed suppression (i.e., multifunctionality). Understanding variation in these relationships across farms can help advance trait-based research in agroecology and ecological approaches to nutrient management. This on-farm experiment explored the contributions of two- and three-species cover crop mixtures, which combined legumes, brassicas and cool season grasses, to ecosystem functions across a gradient of soil fertility levels driven by farm management history. I evaluated the predictions that functional trait diversity of the cover crops would explain variation in multifunctionality, and that legume biomass and BNF within mixtures would be inversely correlated with indicators of soil N availability from organic matter across the farm gradient. Ecosystem functions varied widely across farms. As expected, functional diversity was a significant predictor of multifunctionality, although the relationship was weak. Cover crop mixtures had significantly greater multifunctionality than a cereal rye monoculture, though not at the highest observed levels of each function, indicating trade-offs among functions. Linear regression models showed that legume biomass and BNF were negatively correlated with soil properties indicative of N availability from soil organic matter, whereas non-legume and weed biomass were positively correlated with other measures of soil fertility. Synthesis and applications. Cover crop mixtures can increase functional diversity within crop rotations. Designing mixtures with complementary plant traits may be particularly effective for increasing multifunctionality and agroecosystem sustainability. On-farm research to understand variation in biological nitrogen fixation, which is both a plant trait and a key ecosystem function, across heterogeneous soil conditions, can inform management of soil fertility based on ecological principles.},

abstract = {Previous grassland biodiversity experiments were carried out in uniform environments. It is conceivable, however, that biodiversity effects on community characteristics such as primary productivity might be enhanced under more realistic levels of environmental heterogeneity, if this allows complementary resource use by different species in mixture. Therefore, we would expect larger complementarity effects between species in a heterogeneous environment than in a uniform environment. We tested these hypotheses with experiments in four non-overlapping species pools containing the three functional groups grasses, herbs and legumes. We established all species in monoculture, 3- and 6-species mixture on plots with horizontally heterogeneous or uniform distribution of the same total amount of soil nutrients. The positive net biodiversity effects on aboveground biomass production were similar in both heterogeneous and uniform environment. When the net biodiversity effects were partitioned into components, however, it became clear that in the heterogeneous environment they were due to increased complementarity among species whereas in the uniform environment dominance of species with high monoculture yield played also an important role. {\textcopyright} 2007 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

Because dominants differ widely in phenology and resource use, dominants may control the recruitment and establishment of other species. Aims: To explore the relationship between the identity of the dominant species and successional vegetation changes in grassland communities. Methods: The compositional change over 23 years in 1900 permanent plots dominated by four grasses (Andropogon gerardii, Elymus repens, Poa pratensis and Schizachyrium scoparium) was examined within 19 old fields in Minnesota. Fields were abandoned 1-56 years before sampling. Rate of directional change and degree of compositional dissimilarity were determined. Results: Non-natives, P. pratensis and E. repens, were associated with either no or a slow directional change. Elymus repens was associated with high dissimilarity and P. pratensis with intermediate dissimilarity. Natives, A. gerardii and S. scoparium, were associated with compositional change that followed expectations based on field age. The rate of directional change and degree of dissimilarity between sampling intervals was lower for A. gerardii relative to S. scoparium, the only species to be associated with strong directional change. Conclusions: Dominance by non-native grass species may impede traditional successional processes and result in a community composition quite dissimilar from native prairies.},

abstract = {espite a long history of the study of tropical forests, uncertainty about the importance of different ecological processes in shaping tropical tree species distributions persists. Trait- and phylogenetic-based tests of community assembly provide a powerful way to detect community assembly processes but have seldom been applied to the same community. Both methods are well suited to testing how the relative importance of different ecological processes changes with spatial scale. Here we apply both methods to the Yasuni Forest Dynamics Plot, a 25-ha Amazonian forest with {\textgreater}1100 tree species. We found evidence for habitat filtering from both trait and phylogenetic methods from small (25 m2) to intermediate (10000 m2) spatial scales. Trait-based methods detected even spacing of strategies, a pattern consistent with niche partitioning or enemy-mediated density dependence, at smaller spatial scales (25-400 m2). Simulation modeling of community assembly processes suggests that low statistical power to detect even spacing of traits at larger spatial scales may contribute to the observed patterns. Trait and phylogenetic methods tended to identify the same areas of the forest as being subject to habitat filtering. Phylogenetic community tests, which are far less data-intensive than trait-based methods, captured much of the same filtering patterns detected by trait-based methods but often failed to detect even-spacing patterns apparent in trait data. Taken together, it appears that both habitat associations and niche differentiation shape species co-occurrence patterns in one of the most diverse forests in the world at a range of small and intermediate spatial scales.},

abstract = {Green roofs (roofs with a vegetated surface and substrate) provide ecosystem services in urban areas, including improved storm-water management, better regulation of building temperatures, reduced urban heat-island effects, and increased urban wildlife habitat. This article reviews the evidence for these benefits and examines the biotic and abiotic components that contribute to overall ecosystem services. We emphasize the potential for improving green-roof function by understanding the interactions between its ecosystem elements, especially the relationships among growing media, soil biota, and vegetation, and the interactions between community structure and ecosystem functioning. Further research into green-roof technology should assess the efficacy of green roofs compared to other technologies with similar ends, and ultimately focus on estimates of aggregate benefits at landscape scales and on more holistic cost-benefit analyses.},

abstract = {Constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow (HF CWs) have been used for wastewater treatment for more than 30 years. Most HF CWs have been designed to treat municipal or domestic wastewater. Nowadays, municipal HF CWs focus not only on common pollutants but also on special parameters such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptive chemicals or linear alkylbenzensulfonates (LAS). At present, HF CWs are used to treat many other types of wastewater. Industrial applications include wastewaters from oil refineries, chemical factories, pulp and paper production, tannery and textile industries, abattoir, distillery and winery industries. In particular, the use of HF CWs is becoming very common for treatment of food-processing wastewaters (e.g., production and processing of milk, cheese, potatoes, sugar). HF constructed wetlands are also successfully used to treat wastewaters from agriculture (e.g., pig and dairy farms, fish farm effluents) and various runoff waters (agriculture, airports, highway, greenhouses, plant nurseries). HF CWs have also effectively been used to treat landfill leachate. Besides the use as a single unit, HF CWs are also used in combination with other types of constructed wetlands in hybrid systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Niche differences are key to understanding the distribution and structure of biodiver- sity. To examine niche differences, we must first characterize how species occupy niche space, and two approaches are commonly used in the ecological literature. The first uses species traits to estimate mul- tivariate trait space (so-called functional trait diversity, FD); the second quantifies the amount of time or evolutionary history captured by a group of species (phylogenetic diversity, PD). It is often—but controversially—assumed that these putative measures of niche space are at a minimum correlated and perhaps redundant, since more evolutionary time allows for greater accumulation of trait changes. This theoretical expectation remains surprisingly poorly evaluated, particularly in the context ofmulti- variate measures of trait diversity. We evaluated the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and trait diversity using analytical and simulation-based methods across common models of trait evolu- tion. We show that PD correlates with FD increasingly strongly as more traits are included in the FD measure. Our results indicate that phylogenetic diversity can be a useful surrogate for high-dimen- sional trait diversity, but we also show that the correlation weakens when the underlying process of trait},

Most applications have been designed to treat municipal or domestic wastewater but at present, constructed wetlands are successfully applied to many types of wastewater. The early constructed wetlands applied to industrial wastewaters included those for wastewaters from petrochemical, abattoir, meat processing, dairy and pulp and paper industries. During the 1990s constructed wetlands were also used to treat effluents from textile and wine industries or water from recirculating fish and shrimp aquacultures. The most recent applications include those for brewery or tannery wastewaters as well as olive mills effluents. The survey revealed that both subsurface and surface flow constructed wetlands have been used for treatment of industrial wastewaters. Within subsurface flow constructed wetlands both horizontal and vertical flow systems have been designed. Also, the use of various hybrid constructed wetlands for industrial effluent treatment has been reported in the literature recently. The survey also revealed that industrial wastewaters are treated in constructed wetlands in all continents and this paper includes the information from 138 constructed wetlands in 33 countries worldwide.},

abstract = {Two studies were conducted with the objective of quantifying the carbon storage potential of extensive green roofs. The first was performed on eight roofs in Michigan and four roofs in Maryland, ranging from 1 to 6 years in age. All 12 green roofs were composed primarily of Sedum species, and substrate depths ranged from 2.5 to 12.7 cm. Aboveground plant material was harvested in the fall of 2006. On average, these roofs stored 162 g C x m(-2) in aboveground biomass. The second study was conducted on a roof in East Lansing, MI. Twenty plots were established on 21 April 2007 with a substrate depth of 6.0 cm. In addition to a substrate only control, the other plots were sown with a single species of Sedum (S. acre, S. album, S. kamtshaticum, or S. spurium). Species and substrate depth represent typical extensive green roofs in the United States. Plant material and substrate were harvested seven times across two growing seasons. Results at the end of the second year showed that aboveground plant material storage varied by species, ranging from 64 g C x m(-2) (S. acre) to 239 g C x m(-2) (S. album), with an average of 168 g C x m(-2). Belowground biomass ranged from 37 g C x m(-2) (S. acre) to 185 g C x m(-2) (S. kamtschaticum) and averaged 107 g C x m(-2). Substrate carbon content averaged 913 g C x m(-2), with no species effect, which represents a sequestration rate of 100 g C x m(-2) over the 2 years of this study. The entire extensive green roof system sequestered 375 g C x m(-2) in above- and belowground biomass and substrate organic matter.},

abstract = {1. The interaction between mutualism, facilitation or interference and exploitation competition is of major interest as it may govern species coexistence. However, the interplay of these mechanisms has received little attention. This issue dates back to Gause, who experimentally explored competition using protists as a model [Gause, G.F. (1935) V{\'{e}}rifications exp{\'{e}}rimentales de la th{\'{e}}orie math{\'{e}}matique de la lutte pour la vie. Actualit{\'{e}}s Scientifiques et Industrielles, 277]. He showed the coexistence of Paramecium caudatum with a potentially allelopathic species, Paramecium bursaria. 2. Paramecium bursaria hosts the green algae Chlorella vulgaris. Therefore, P. bursaria may benefit from carbohydrates synthesised by the algae. Studying endosymbiosis with P. bursaria is possible as it can be freed of its endosymbiont. In addition, C. vulgaris is known to produce allelochemicals, and P. bursaria may benefit also from allelopathic compounds. 3. We designed an experiment to separate the effects of resource exploitation, endosymbiosis and allelopathy and to assess their relative importance for the coexistence of P. bursaria with a competitor that exploits the same resource, bacteria. The experiment was repeated with two competitors, Colpidium striatum or Tetrahymena pyriformis. 4. Results show that the presence of the endosymbiont enables the coexistence of competitors, while its loss leads to competitive exclusion. These results are in agreement with predictions based on resource equilibrium density of monocultures (R*) supporting the idea that P. bursaria's endosymbiont is a resource provider for its host. When P. bursaria and T. pyriformis coexist, the density of the latter shows large variation that match the effects of culture medium of P. bursaria. Our experiment suggests these effects are because of biochemicals produced in P. bursaria culture. 5. Our results expose the hidden diversity of mechanisms that underlie competitive interactions. They thus support Gauses's speculation (1935) that allelopathic effects might have been involved in his competition experiments. We discuss how a species engaged both in competition for a resource and in costly interference such as allelopathy may counterbalance these costs with a resource-provider endosymbiont.},

abstract = {Four wetland plant species (Scirpus validus, Carex lacustris, Phalaris arundinacea, and Typha latifolia) were grown in monoculture and as a four-species mixture to compare effectiveness of nutrient removal in controlled 18.93-l outdoor subsurface treatment wetland microcosms. A nutrient treatment that mimicked single-resident domestic effluent consisted of two levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [low (56 mg/l N and 31 mg/l P) and high (112 mg/l N and 62 mg/l P)] of nutrient solution applied three times weekly. The plants were established and maintained for one year before the nutrient treatment and monthly water sampling commenced; water sampling began July 31, 2001 and ended October 23, 2001. We tested four hypotheses: (1) vegetated microcosms are more effective at reducing concentrations of total N and total P from soil leachate than unvegetated, (2) there is a differential species effect on the potential to reduce N and P, (3) plant mixtures are more effective than monocultures at reducing N and P, and (4) the microcosms will be least effective at reducing N and P concentrations in October compared to August. We found support for hypotheses 1, 2, and 4, but our results are inconclusive for the third hypothesis. Total N and total P in the soil leachate were significantly higher from unvegetated microcosms compared to vegetated. S. validus was most effective and P. arundinacea was generally least effective at reducing N and P in monocultures, with treatment capabilities similar to unvegetated microcosms. The four-species mixture was generally highly effective at nutrient removal, however the results were not significantly different from the monocultures. At the end of the growing season (October) treatment efficiency was significantly less than earlier months, especially for the unvegetated treatment. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Casuarina equisetifolia was introduced to China in 1897 from Australia to reduce coastal erosion. It grows vigorously and has spread over much of the southern and southeastern coast, from Zhejiang to Guangxi, over a range of more than 10° of latitude. To date, little is known about its interactions with native species in the coastal zone.We used a field experiment to study how the understorey species diversity and soil conditions in monoculture stands of C. equisetifolia were influenced by different native plant species. We also examined the effects of interplanting native species on plant numbers, leaf area index (LAI), and aboveground biomass accumulation. We planted three native species .Hibiscus tiliaceus, Melia azedarach and Calophyllum inophyllum) at two initial densities in stands of C. equisetifolia.Over a period of ten years, the density and aboveground biomass were relatively low in plots planted with three native species compared to plots that were not planted. In contrast, understory diversity and soil conditions were relatively high where native species were added. Moreover, the number of dead tree, aboveground biomass increment, and diameter growth had significant difference among different native tree species because of their different natural characteristics.The fast-growing pioneer species, M. azedarach, had a positive effect on LAI, regeneration, shrub diversity and grass coverage than the other two native species, and M. azedarach was most effective in plots that were initially planted with higher densities. The pioneer plant H. tiliaceus had more individuals and greater aboveground biomass than others native species. The later-succession species C. inophyllum had the smallest effect on the development of understory vegetation and soil conditions over 10-yrs among three native plants. For different native planted species, M. azedarach showed good effects on the average annual aboveground biomass and DBH increment, and C. inophyllum had the least dead number in coastal environments.In summary, C. equisetifolia and native species have facilitation relationships that differ according to the species, and coastal conservation managers should shift from their traditional focus on C. equisetifolia afforestation to the recognition of multi-species configuration. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Predicting community and species responses to disturbance is complicated by incomplete knowledge about species traits. A phylogenetic framework should partially solve this problem, as trait similarity is generally correlated with species relatedness, closely related species should have similar sensitivities to disturbance. Disturbance should thus result in community assemblages of closely related species. We tested this hypothesis with 18 disturbed and 16 reference whole-lake, long-term zooplankton data sets. Regardless of disturbance type, communities generally contained more closely related species when disturbed. This effect was independent of species richness, evenness, and abundance. Communities already under stress (i.e., those in acidic lakes) changed most when disturbed. Species sensitivities to specific disturbances were phylogenetically conserved, were independent of body size, and could be predicted by the sensitivities of close relatives within the same community. Phylogenetic relatedness can effectively act as a proxy for missing trait information when predicting community and species responses to disturbance},

abstract = {A growing body of evidence from community genetics studies suggests that ecosystem functions supported by plant species richness can also be provided by genetic diversity within plant species. This is not yet true for the diversity-resistance relationship as it is still unclear whether damage by insect herbivores responds to genetic diversity in host plant populations. We developed a manipulative field experiment based on a synthetic community approach, with 15 mixtures of one to four oak (Quercus robur) half-sib families. We quantified genetic diversity at the plot level by genotyping all oak saplings and assessed overall damage caused by ectophagous and endophagous herbivores along a gradient of increasing genetic diversity. Damage due to ectophagous herbivores increased with the genetic diversity in oak sapling populations as a result of higher levels of damage in mixtures than in monocultures for all families (complementarity effect) rather than because of the presence of more susceptible oak genotypes in mixtures (selection effect). Assemblages of different oak genotypes would benefit polyphagous herbivores via improved host patch location, spill over among neighbouring saplings and diet mixing. By contrast, genetic diversity was a poor predictor of the abundance of endophagous herbivores, which increased with individual sapling apparency. Plant genetic diversity may not provide sufficient functional contrast to prevent tree sapling colonization by specialist herbivores while enhancing the foraging of generalist herbivores. Long term studies are nevertheless required to test whether the effect of genetic diversity on herbivory change with the ontogeny of trees and local adaptation of specialist herbivores.},

abstract = {The positive relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species diversity is a widely accepted concept, generally associated with niche limitation. However, niche limitation cannot account for negative heterogeneity-diversity relationships (HDR) revealed in several case studies. Here we explore how HDR varies at different spatial scales and provide novel theories for small-scale species co-existence that explain both positive and negative HDR. At large spatial scales of heterogeneity (e.g. landscape level), different communities co-exist, promoting large regional species pool size and resulting in positive HDR. At smaller scales within communities, species co-existence can be enhanced by increasing the number of different patches, as predicted by the niche limitation theory, or alternatively, restrained by heterogeneity. We conducted meta-regressions for experimental and observational HDR studies, and found that negative HDRs are significantly more common at smaller spatial scales. We propose three theories to account for niche limitation at small spatial scales. (1) Microfragmentation theory: with increasing spatial heterogeneity, large homogeneous patches lose area and become isolated, which in turn restrains the establishment of new plant individuals and populations, thus reducing species richness. (2) Heterogeneity confounded by mean: when heterogeneity occurs at spatial scales smaller than the size of individual plants, which forage through the patches, species diversity can be either positively or negatively affected by a change in the mean of an environmental factor. (3) Heterogeneity as a separate niche axis: the ability of species to tolerate heterogeneity at spatial scales smaller than plant size varies, affecting HDR. We conclude that processes other than niche limitation can affect the relationship between heterogeneity and diversity.},

The framework for future expansion of ethanol production, to meet with supply needs at national and international levels using the current production model, does not take into consideration the prospect of Brazil's regional and rural development. Although currently there are no impediments to the culture of sugar cane in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, Brazil's largest producer of biodiesel, it imports 98{\%} of its demand for ethanol from S{\~{a}}o Paulo and other regions. The promotion of ethanol market in that State might pass for a productive model different from the practice in industrial monocultures, given their cultural and agricultural characteristics.

abstract = {Specific root length (SRL) and root tissue density (RTD) are ecologically functional traits which are calculated from root length or volume and root dry weight. Both can be converted into each other using the root diameter assuming roots are cylindrical. The calculation of volume from length or length from volume is, however, problematic because samples of roots do usually not have a constant diameter. Ignorance of the diameter heterogeneity leads to an overestimation of length and an underestimation of volume if standard formulas are used. Here I show for two datasets that SRL and RTD are overestimated on average 67{\%} for the two analyzed datasets, but up to 150{\%}, if calculated from each other. I further highlight that the volume values for the total sample as provided by the commonly used software WinRHIZO(TM) should only be used for objects with constant diameter. I recommend to use volume values provided for each diameter class of a sample if WinRHIZO(TM) is used. If manual methods, like the line-intersect method, are used, roots should be separated into diameter classes before length measurements if the volume is calculated from length. Trait to trait conversions for whole samples are not recommended.},

abstract = {The spatial distributions of water and nutrients were examined in the desert grassland of Helan Mountain to test the hypothesis that the expansion of shrub patches in the grassland is associated with the degree of soil heterogeneity. The results showed that shrub patches significantly increase the water content and nutrient enrichment in surface soil (0-10 cm), and increase the microscale heterogeneity of the soil. Geostatistics analysis indicated that the autocorrelation distances of soil properties, such as water, total nitrogen (TN), organic matter (OM), and pH, are larger than the mean canopy size of Salsola passerina (30±12.3 cm), but less than in the control (enclosed) grassland. This suggests that the spatial distribution of soil properties may be associated with biotic processes in the shrub patch site. Furthermore, the smaller autocorrelation distances (65-382 cm) found for all soil properties indicate an increase in spatial heterogeneity, or potentially degradation, in the enclosed grassland. Based on these results, a conceptual model of montane grassland degradation processes following overgrazing was developed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geneticists and breeders are positioned to breed plants with root traits that improve productivity under drought. However, a better understanding of root functional traits and how traits are related to whole plant strategies to increase crop productivity under different drought conditions is needed. Root traits associated with maintaining plant productivity under drought include small fine root diameters, long specific root length, and considerable root length density, especially at depths in soil with available water. In environments with late season water deficits, small xylem diameters in targeted seminal roots save soil water deep in the soil profile for use during crop maturation and result in improved yields. Capacity for deep root growth and large xylem diameters in deep roots may also improve root acquisition of water when ample water at depth is available. Xylem pit anatomy that makes xylem less "leaky" and prone to cavitation warrants further exploration holding promise that such traits may improve plant productivity in water-limited environments without negatively impacting yield under adequate water conditions. Rapid resumption of root growth following soil rewetting may improve plant productivity under episodic drought. Genetic control of many of these traits through breeding appears feasible. Several recent reviews have covered methods for screening root traits but an appreciation for the complexity of root systems (e.g., functional differences between fine and coarse roots) needs to be paired with these methods to successfully identify relevant traits for crop improvement. Screening of root traits at early stages in plant development can proxy traits at mature stages but verification is needed on a case by case basis that traits are linked to increased crop productivity under drought. Examples in lesquerella (Physaria) and rice (Oryza) show approaches to phenotyping of root traits and current understanding of root trait genetics for breeding.},

abstract = {Domestic gardens provide a significant component of urban green infrastructure but their relative contribution to eco-system service provision remains largely un-quantified. 'Green infrastructure' itself is often ill-defined, posing problems for planners to ascertain what types of green infrastructure provide greatest benefit and under what circumstances. Within this context the relative merits of gardens are unclear; however, at a time of greater urbanization where private gardens are increasingly seen as a 'luxury', it is important to define their role precisely. Hence, the nature of this review is to interpret existing information pertaining to gardens/gardening . per se, identify where they may have a unique role to play and to highlight where further research is warranted. The review suggests that there are significant differences in both form and management of domestic gardens which radically influence the benefits. Nevertheless, gardens can play a strong role in improving the environmental impact of the domestic curtilage, e.g. by insulating houses against temperature extremes they can reduce domestic energy use. Gardens also improve localized air cooling, help mitigate flooding and provide a haven for wildlife. Less favourable aspects include contributions of gardens and gardening to greenhouse gas emissions, misuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and introduction of alien plant species. Due to the close proximity to the home and hence accessibility for many, possibly the greatest benefit of the domestic garden is on human health and well-being, but further work is required to define this clearly within the wider context of green infrastructure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {We tested predictions of the relative changes in plant leaf traits in response to land uses in Australian eucalypt grassy ecosystems. Predictions were determined from responses observed in European landscapes in relation to disturbances associated with agricultural land uses. We measured specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) across five land uses: reference sites (closest to pre-European state), native pastures (unfertilized), fertilized pastures, sown pastures (cultivated and fertilized) and enriched grassland (previously fertilized, no longer grazed). Leaves were expected to have higher SLA and lower LMDC at sites with increasing fertility and/or disturbance. The predictions were confirmed, with SLA increasing progressively in land uses associated with (1) grazing; (2) grazing and fertilization; (3) grazing, fertilization and cultivation. Values for LDMC were closely (but inversely) correlated with those of SLA. For both traits, there were relationships with available soil phosphorus but not with soil total nitrogen. The positive correlation of SLA with phosphorus was not evident above 30 mg kg-1, the recommended level of phosphorus for improved pastures. Results confirm patterns of leaf-trait response to disturbance that reflect fundamental constraints to plant survival in habitats with different levels of resources and disturbances. A conservative strategy for low productivity undisturbed habitats is associated with low SLA and high dry matter content in contrast to fertile disturbed habitats which select for high SLA and low dry matter content. The changes in leaf traits across land uses resulted from species substitution rather than variation within species across sites, and most notably the replacement of native by annual exotic species as land use intensifies. Recommended fertilization rates for pasture production convert the ground layer to plants with soft, digestible leaves, that are responsive to fertilizer and desirable for livestock production. However, fertilization also drastically reduces the diversity of native plants and annual plants tend to dominate. The trade-off associated with high production includes increased vulnerability to soil erosion, due to reduced plant cover and low persistence of cover. If alternative ecosystem values such as erosion control, water quality, salinity control and biodiversity persistence are required, incentives may be needed to offset the loss of production that can be gained from fertilizer application.

abstract = {Abstract Plant species richness influences primary productivity via mechanisms that (1) favour species with particular traits (selection effect) and (2) promote niche differentiation between species (complementarity). Influences of species evenness, plant density and other properties of plant communities on productivity are poorly defined, but may depend on whether selection or complementarity prevails in species mixtures. We predicted that selection effects are insensitive to species evenness but increase with plant density, and that the converse is true for complementarity. To test predictions, we grew three species of annuals in monocultures and in three-species mixtures in which evenness of established plants was varied at each of three plant densities in a cultivated field in Texas, USA. Above-ground biomass was smaller in mixtures than expected from monocultures because of negative ‘complementarity' and a negative selection effect. Neither selection nor complementarity varied with species evenness, but selection effects increased at the greatest plant density as predicted.},

abstract = {Invertebrate herbivores can impact plant performance and plant communities. Conversely, plants can affect the ability of herbivores to find, choose, and consume them through their functional traits. While single plant traits have been related to rates of herbivory, most often involving single herbivore-plant pairs, much less is known about which suite of plant traits is important for determining herbivory for a pool of plant species interacting with a natural herbivore community. In this study we measured aboveground herbivore damage on 51 herbaceous species growing in monocultures of a grassland biodiversity experiment and collected 42 different plant traits representing four trait groups: physiological, morphological, phenological, and herbivore related. Using the method of random forests and multiple regression, we identified seven traits that are important predictors of herbivore damage (leaf nitrogen and lignin concentration, number of coleopteran and hemipteran herbivores potentially feeding on the plants, leaf life span, stem growth form, and root architecture); leaf nitrogen and lignin concentration were the two most important predictors. The final model accounted for 63{\%} of the variation in herbivore damage. Traits from all four trait groups were selected, showing that a variety of plant characteristics can be statistically important when assessing folivory, including root traits. Our results emphasize that it is necessary to use a multivariate approach for identifying traits affecting complex ecological processes such as herbivory.},

abstract = {Sulfate in effluent is a challenging issue for wastewater reuse around the world. In this study, sulfur (S) removal and transformation in five batch constructed wetlands (CWs) treating secondary effluent were investigated. The results showed that the presence of the plant cattail (Typha latifolia) had little effect on sulfate removal, while the carbon-rich litter it generated greatly improved sulfate removal, but with limited sulfide accumulation in the pore-water. After sulfate removal, most of the S was deposited with the valence states S (-II) and S (0) on the iron-rich gravel surface, and acid volatile sulfide was the main S sink in the litter-added CWs. High-throughput pyrosequencing revealed that sulfate-reducing bacteria (i.e. Desulfobacter) and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (i.e. Thiobacillus) were dominant in the litter-added CWs, which led to a sustainable S cycle between sulfate and sulfide. Overall, this study suggests that recycling plant litter and iron-rich filling material in CWs gives an opportunity to utilize the S in the wastewater as both an electron acceptor for sulfate reduction and as an electron donor for nitrate reduction coupled with sulfide oxidation. This leads to the simultaneous removal of sulfate, nitrate, and organics without discharging toxic sulfide into the receiving water body.},

We separated the observed diversity effects on carbon uptake into those caused by species with particularly important traits (selection effect) and those caused by positive interactions among species (e.g., complementary resource use or facilitation [complementarity effect]). Additionally, we measured the composition of photosynthetically active pigments and light absorbance in communities and monocultures, and related them to species and functional diversity effects on carbon accrual. Biodiversity effects were weak or even absent in pure cyanobacterial and diatom communities compared to strong effects in chlorophytes. Complementarity effects and light absorbance increased as functional (i.e., phylogenetic) diversity increased. There was a positive correlation between complementarity effects on carbon accrual and light absorbance. These findings support hypotheses regarding biodiversity-productivity relationships in phytoplankton communities based on niche separation along spectral light gradients.},

abstract = {The San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary (SJWS), Irvine, CA, is a 32 ha series of shallow ponds created to maximize nitrate removal rates while maintaining 90{\%} open water and episodically exposed shoreline for avian habitat. Design elements created non-ideal denitrification conditions by diminishing an organic carbon source (emergent vegetation) and increasing sediment exposure to oxygen. SJWS aqueous nitrogen and avian data (1999-2002) were analyzed to discern whether design and operating conditions allowed for simultaneous nitrate removal and diverse, abundant avian habitat. Average TIN removal efficiency was 80{\%} while average TN removal efficiency was 60{\%}; the difference reflects Org-N production in the marsh. Based on Chl-a measurements, roughly 40{\%} of Org-N produced in the system was present as algae. The highest annual nitrate removal rates occurred April-May (350-500 mg/m2/d) and September-October (250-425 mg/m2/d). First order rate constants ranged 30.7-47.5 m year-1. Seasonal plantings of barnyard grass (Echinocloa crus-galli) were intended to serve as a carbon amendment for denitrification, however, there was no difference in nitrate removal between amended and non-amended conditions, likely because data averaging obscured a small, localized enhancement signal. Average avian species richness was high, ranging between 65 and 76 species month-1, while average relative abundance was mid-range, at 65-83 birds ha-1month-1.

abstract = {Focusing on the response of soil mesofauna to winter rye cultivation in monoculture for 90 years, the study investigated the abundance and diversity of soil-dwelling springtails, in relation to a five-field crop rotation. A long-term monoculture experiment was established in Poland in 1923 and has been continued uninterruptedly to the present time. Soil samples were taken over a period of three years (2011–2013) to determine springtail (Collembola) abundance, species composition and life-forms spectra. We hypothesize that the crop rotation indirectly, due to the residues from the previous crops and modified soil conditions, caused the increase of the abundance and species diversity of springtails in comparison to monoculture. Generally, springtails were more abundant in the soil of rye field cultivated within a 5-field crop rotation. For the majority of sampling dates the abundance of springtails was higher in that habitat in comparison to the monoculture. Also, the calculated ecological indices showed greater diversity in the crop rotation. This treatment was dominated by the three species – Hypogastrura manubrialis, Mesaphorura macrochaeta and Ceratophysella denticulata, but in the monoculture only M. macrochaeta was distinctly numerous. Hemiedaphic springtails dominated in the crop rotation, whereas in the monoculture the most abundant were euedaphic representatives. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the studied organisms were influenced by two factors – treatment and the sampling date. We suspect that the unbeneficial soil conditions in certain sampling dates had greater impact on Collembola community than the crop rotation system.},

Strategies that have evolved in desert plants can play significant roles in the use of plants for green covers. In the following, we will specifically focus on (1) heat and radiation, (2) drought, and (3) salinity. Further, we will discuss (4) interactions between neighboring plants. Finally, we will (5) propose a design for diverse green roofs that includes horticultural and medicinal products and provides diverse habitats. Many desert plants have developed morphological and anatomical features to avoid photo-inhibition, which can be advantageous for growth on green roofs. Plants exhibiting C4 photosynthesis or crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis have a protected hydraulic system that enables growth under dry conditions. Furthermore, dew and high levels of relative humidity can provide reliable water sources under limited precipitation. Halophytes are protected against salinity, ionic specific stress, and nutritional imbalances, characteristics that can be advantageous for green roofs. Under limited space, competition for resources becomes increasingly relevant. Allelopathy can also induce the germination and growth inhibition of neighboring plants. Many desert plants, as a result of their exposure to environmental stress, have developed unique survival adaptations based on secondary metabolites that can be used as pharmaceuticals. A systematic survey of plant strategies to withstand these extreme conditions provides a basis for increasing the number of green roof candidates. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity has recently received increased attention due to its effect on biological diversity, ecosystem services and ecological resilience to disturbance and hazards. However, its relationships with landscape complexity as an indicator of visual aesthetic quality have not been yet extensively discussed. The purpose of this paper is to review different dimensions of environmental heterogeneity and to explore their potential for bridging visual quality with provision of other ecosystem services and resilience in landscape design, management and planning. This synthesis reveals the substantial overlap between spatial and temporal indicators of heterogeneity from ecological literature and the indicators of visual complexity, diversity and variety from the studies of subjective preferences and objective scenic beauty criteria. The potential of heterogeneity is also reviewed in the context of the relationship between visual quality and ecological resilience to perturbations, an increasingly important objective in the face of the global environmental change. The limitations of heterogeneity as a design and management goal are also discussed, including links between heterogeneity and disturbance, undesirable outcomes of excessive landscape complexity and present lack of criteria for its optimal levels. The synthesis concludes by identifying the key strategies and research needs to facilitate the application of this concept towards multi-functional landscapes supporting versatile ecosystem services together with scenic priorities.},

abstract = {Plants species have been shown to improve the performance of stormwater biofiltration systems, particularly in removal of N and P. Recent research has shown that plants vary in their contribution to pollutant removal but little is known about the type of plant that is best suited to use in biofilters in terms of survival, growth rate, and performance. In this study, growth responses of 20 species to applications of semi-synthetic stormwater were measured, and the roles of key plant traits in removal of N, P, and several metals were investigated. There was no evidence of negative effects of stormwater application on plant growth, and plant traits, particularly root traits, were strongly correlated negatively with N and P concentrations of effluent stormwater. The most common and strong contributors to N and P removal appeared to be the length of the longest root, rooting depth, total root length, and root mass. The plants that made the strongest contribution to pollutant removal, e.g, Carex appressa, combined these traits with high growth rates. Investigation of other plant traits (e.g, physiology), causal mechanisms, and effects of more complex planting environments (e.g, species mixtures) should further guide the selection of plants to enhance performance of biofiltration systems.},

abstract = {1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped accord- ing to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem func- tioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assem- blages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exer- cised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental con- ditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

abstract = {Plant diversity is generally thought to enhance productivity, driven by either (1) chance inclusion of highly productive species in more diverse communities or (2) niche-based resource acquisition with competitive interactions increasing resource use efficiency. Here, we ask whether weeding, as employed in most experiments to date, might contribute to the positive diversity-productivity relationship reported for many grasslands. Using all 82 species from our local pool, we constructed 357 experimental grassland plots (2 x 4 m each), arranged as a completely randomized experiment in an arable field prepared to minimize existing seed bank. The plots were sown to vary species richness (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 species) and were maintained under both ambient conditions and experimental drought. A single monoculture plot was maintained for all 82 species, and each of the other eleven species richness levels was replicated 25 times. Plots were maintained strictly without weeding, and aboveground biomass was measured at 17, 19, 27 and 29 months after the start of this experiment. No single measure of biodiversity was significantly correlated with productivity consistently across all four sampling periods. Furthermore, there were only weak overall effects of six biodiversity variables (the species richness planted, observed, and sampled; Shannon diversity, effective species richness and evenness in the sampled area) on productivity under either precipitation treatment. Regression analysis identified no equation that used a consistent subset of the biodiversity measures as predictors. In view of these transient and insubstantial effects, results from previous experiments that employed weeding treatments are suspect as tests of the hypothesis that biodiversity has positive effects on productivity.},

abstract = {Two studies were conducted on a third-story rooftop to quantify the effect of solar radiation (full sun versus full shade) on several US native and non-native species for potential use on extensive green roofs. In the first study, plugs of six native and three non-native species were planted in May 2005 on substrates of two different depths (8.0 and 12.0 cm) both in sun and shade. Absolute cover (AC) was recorded using a point-frame transect during the growing season beginning in June 2005 and every 2 weeks thereafter for a period of 4 years. By week 174 (23 September 2008), most species exhibited different AC within a depth between sun and shade. However, when all species were combined, overall AC did not differ between sun and shade within a depth. This indicated that while species make-up was changing among solar radiation levels, that overall coverage was not significantly different between sun and shade. For all substrate depths and solar levels, the most abundant species were Sedum acre, Allium cernuum, Sedum album 'Coral Carpet', and Talinum calycinum. Less abundant species included Talinum parviflorum, Carex flacca, Sedum stenopetalum, and Sedum divergens, which all exhibited 0 or near 0 AC regardless of depth or solar radiation levels. With the exception of T. calycinum, native species were less abundant than non-native species. In the second study, six common extensive green roof species of Sedum established from seed in May 2005 on a 10.0 cm (3.9 in) substrate depth were compared in both sun and shade over four growing seasons. AC was evaluated as in the previous study. Solar radiation did not affect AC, but overall species composition differed between sun and shade levels. The most abundant species in full sun were S. acre (0.57 AC) and S. album 'Coral Carpet' (0.51 AC). Sedum kamtschaticum (0.57 AC) and Sedum spurium 'Coccineum' (0.35 AC) performed the best in the shade. For both solar levels, the least abundant species at week 174 were Sedum pulchellum (0.0 AC) and S. album 'Coral Carpet' (0.1 AC). {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Research into mixed-forests has increased substantially in the last decades but the extent to which the new knowledge generated meets practitioners' concerns and is adequately transmitted to them is unknown. Here we provide the current state of knowledge and future research directions with regards to 10 questions about mixed-forest functioning and management identified and selected by a range of European forest managers during an extensive participatory process. The set of 10 questions were the highest ranked questions from an online prioritization exercise involving 168 managers from 22 different European countries. In general, the topics of major concern for forest managers coincided with the ones that are at the heart of most research projects. They covered important issues related to the management of mixed forests and the role of mixtures for the stability of forests faced with environmental changes and the provision of ecosystem services to society. Our analysis showed that the current scientific knowledge about these questions was rather variable and particularly low for those related to the management of mixed forests over time and the associated costs. We also found that whereas most research projects have sought to evaluate whether mixed forests are more stable or provide more goods and services than monocultures, there is still little information on the underlying mechanisms and trade-offs behind these effects. Similarly, we identified a lack of knowledge on the spatio-temporal scales at which the effects of mixtures on the resistance and adaptability to environmental changes are operating. Our analysis may help researchers to identify what knowledge needs to be better transferred and to better design future research initiatives meeting practitioner's concerns.},

abstract = {Climate change has an impact on all levels of biodiversity: genes, species, populations and ecosystems. This effect is expected to be dependent on the rate of change. When faced with unfavorable environmental conditions, individuals have three non-exclusive options by which they can mitigate these changes: temporal alterations in phenology, spatial tracking of optimal conditions or in situ adaptation. For the latter to occur requires the existence of variability among conspecifics with respect to traits that directly or indirectly influence individual performance and fitness. One such "functional" trait is thermal stress tolerance. We investigated the presence of intraspecific functional trait variability of isofemale lineages of the free-living marine nematode Litoditis marina in monoculture, double and quadruple mixtures under thermal stress, which was applied in a gradient and a sudden treatment over 20. days, corresponding to at least four generations. We found a high degree of intraspecific functional trait variability relevant to thermal tolerance. This type of variability has traditionally been considered negligible compared to interspecific variation, but our results demonstrate the importance of its inclusion within trait-based eco-evolutionary studies as this will confer increased accuracy when inputting physiological parameters to relevant models (e.g. species distribution models). Additionally, we found a significant effect of the temperature treatments. In accordance with the majority of experimental evidence, our populations showed a stronger response to a sudden versus a gradient increase in temperature. Contrary to our expectations, no significant differences were observed between monocultures, double and quadruple lineage mixtures suggesting that increased intraspecific trait variability did not lead to higher fitness in L. marina populations exposed to thermal stress.},

We conducted a series of field and mesocosm experiments to measure the relative effects of macroalgal identity and richness on primary productivity (net photosynthetic rate) and biomass accumulation in hard substratum subtidal communities in North Carolina, USA. Algal identity consistently and strongly affected production; species richness effects, although often significent, were subtle. Partitioning of the net biodiversity effect indicated that complementarity effects were always positive and species were usually more productive in mixtures than in monoculture. Surprisingly, slow growing species performed relatively better in the most diverse treatments than the most productive species, thus selection effects were consistently negative. Our results suggest that several basic mechanisms underlying terrestrial plant biodiversity effects also operate in algal-based marine ecosystems, and thus may be general.},

abstract = {Urban areas are among the most heavily managed landscapes in the world, yet they harbor a remarkable richness of species. Private yards are common habitats in urban areas and are places where cultivated species manage to escape cultivation and become part of the spontaneous species pool. Yards are novel ecosystems where community assembly is driven by both natural and anthropogenic processes. Phylogenetic diversity and functional traits are increasingly recognized as critical to understanding processes of community assembly. Recent evidence indicates that urban areas may select more closely related plant species from the pool of regionally occurring species than do nonurban areas, and that exotic species are phylogenetically clustered within communities. We tested whether phylogenetic diversity and functional trait composition in privately managed yards change along a gradient of housing density in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolis, Minnesota, USA, in accordance with these predictions. We also identified characteristics of the spontaneous yard flora by comparing its phylogenetic diversity and functional composition with the ‘‘natural-areas'' species pool represented by the flora of nearby Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. Along the urbanization gradient, yards had more species per hectare in densely built regions than in lower-density regions, but phylogenetic diversity and functional composition did not change with housing density. In contrast, in comparison to species in natural areas, yard species were more closely related to each other and functionally distinct: They were more often short-lived, self-compatible, and had higher specific leaf area than species of Cedar Creek. The high number of exotic yard species increased the yard flora's phylogenetic relatedness in comparison to species of Cedar Creek, causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners' preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries, their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in comparison to species of Cedar Creek, causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners' preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries, their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in urban environments and beyond, such as accelerating decomposition rates. Limited phylogenetic diversity may reduce the potential of ecosystems to respond to environmental changes. As cities continue to expand globally, understanding the impacts of yard management for biodiversity and ecosystem services becomes increasingly important.},

abstract = {Experiments that have manipulated species richness with random draws of species from a larger species pool have usually found that invasibility declines as richness increases. These results have usually been attributed to niche complementarity, and interpreted to mean that communities will become less resistant to invaders as species go locally extinct. However, it is not clear how relevant these studies are to real-world situations where species extinctions are non-random, and where species diversity declines due to increased rarity (i.e. reduced evenness) without having local extinctions. We experimentally varied species richness from 1 to 4, and evenness from 0.44 to 0.97 with two different extinction scenarios in two-year old plantings using seedling transplants in western Iowa. In both scenarios, evenness was varied by changing the level of dominance of the tall grass Andropogon gerardii. In one scenario, which simulated a loss of short species from Andropogon communities, we directly tested for complementarity in light capture due to having species in mixtures with dissimilar heights. We contrasted this scenario with a second set of mixtures that contained all tall species. In both cases, we controlled for factors such as rooting depth and planting density. Mean invader biomass was higher in monocultures (5.4 g m(-2) week(-1)) than in 4-species mixtures (3.2 g m(-2) week(-1)). Reduced evenness did not affect invader biomass in mixtures with dissimilar heights. However, the amount of invader biomass decreased by 60{\%} as evenness increased across mixtures with all tall species. This difference was most pronounced early in the growing season when high evenness plots had greater light capture than low evenness plots. These results suggest that the effect of reduced species diversity on invasibility are 1) not related to complementarity through height dissimilarity, and 2) variable depending on the phenological traits of the species that are becoming rare or going locally extinct.},

abstract = {Native grasslands are valued for biodiversity and supporting dormant season grazing, but are prone to invasion. In western Canada, revegetation of Festuca campestris grasslands may be hindered by Poa pratensis, an invasive grass. To determine the competitive interaction of these species during establishment, two greenhouse experiments were conducted where F. campestris seedlings were planted in monocultures or mixtures with P. pratensis. The first experiment used equal-aged (3-month old) seedlings of both species, while the second experiment used unequal-aged seedlings (4-month-old F. campestris and 2-month-old P. pratensis). Seedling performance was measured in response to manipulations of water and nitrogen, defoliation, and plant neighbor. While water and nitrogen reduced the biomass and vegetative reproduction (tillering) of F. campestris, exposure to P. pratensis most strongly limited the growth of F. campestris seedlings regardless of other treatments. More frequent and consistent decreases in F. campestris due to P. pratensis were observed in older F. campestris seedlings than younger seedlings. Defoliation also reduced the growth of F. campestris, and the added presence of P. pratensis during defoliation further enhanced these reductions in younger, equal-aged bunchgrass seedlings. Overall, these results suggest that when restoring native F. campestris grasslands, early establishment may be improved by reducing the negative impacts of P. pratensis, and avoiding severe defoliation.},

abstract = {The ability to predict the responses of ecological communities and individual species to human-induced environmental change remains a key issue for ecologists and conservation managers alike. Responses are often variable among species within groups making general predictions difficult. One option is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this "trait-guild" approach has been used for single disturbances, the importance of particular traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural intensification, pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests - above vs. below ground - significantly affected response to habitat loss, agricultural intensification, tillage regime (within agriculture) and fire. Species that nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In contrast below-ground-nesting species were more negatively affected by tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response of different nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn. Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body size did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in determining many aspects of individuals' interaction with their environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored, individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of related species to global change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {There now is ample experimental evidence that speciose assemblages are more productive and provide a greater amount of ecosystem services than depauperate ones. However, these experiments often conclude that there is a higher probability of including complementary species combinations in assemblages with more species and lack a priori prediction about which species combinations maximize function. Here, I report the results of an experiment manipulating the evolutionary relatedness of constituent plant species across a richness gradient. I show that assemblages with distantly related species contributed most to the higher biomass production in multispecies assemblages, through species complementarity. Species produced more biomass than predicted from their monocultures when they were in plots with distantly related species and produced the amount of biomass predicted from monoculture when sown with close relatives. This finding suggests that in the absence of any other information, combining distantly related species in restored or managed landscapes may serve to maximize biomass production and carbon sequestration, thus merging calls to conserve evolutionary history and maximize ecosystem function.},

abstract = {The influence of plant diversity on belowground ecosystem processes and feedbacks of the latter on plant growth are still largely unexplored. A previous field experiment showed positive effects of plant diversity on diversity and activity of culturable soil bacteria. We examined soil carry-over effects of these experimental communities on subsequent plant growth and the development of soil microbial communities in pots. We inoculated sterile substrate with soil from the field experiment and then sowed three plant species - Dactylis glomerata, Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium pratense - as monocultures or 3-species mixtures into the pots. We measured the phytometers over a period of 14 months. Thereafter, we sampled the soil in 3-species mixtures to analyze microbial communities. The original plant species richness and number of functional groups had positive soil carry-over effects on phytometer germination. Furthermore, in mixtures, species richness also stimulated short-term biomass production of phytometers and catabolic diversity of culturable soil bacteria. The number of plant functional groups had a positive effect on the amount of prokaryotic phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) but negative effects on the amount of eukaryotic PLFAs and the activity of culturable soil bacteria. The carry-over effects of plant diversity on phytometer growth disappeared with time. However, specific effects of the presence of particular functional groups or species in the original plant communities remained significant and were sometimes paralleled by effects on soil microbial communities. These results suggest that in the short term, soil carry-over effects of plant diversity are mediated by a general stimulation of soil microbes whereas the longer-term effects of particular plant species are more likely due to compositional shifts in soil microbial communities. Although the mechanisms of soil carry-over effects in biodiversity experiments remain to be determined, our study demonstrates that they exist and probably involve soil microbial communities. This 'memory' of soils may be an important factor in ecosystem development. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.Ecological trade-offs are fundamental to theory in community ecology; critical for understanding species coexistence in diverse plant communities, as well as the evolution of diverse life-history strategies. Invasions by exotic species can provide insights into the importance of trade-offs in community assembly, because the ecological strategies of invading species often differ from those present in the native species pool. Exotic annual species have invaded many Mediterranean-climate areas around the globe, and often germinate and emerge earlier in the growing season than native species. Early-season growth can enable exotic annual species to preempt space and resources, competitively suppressing later-emerging native species; however, early-emerging individuals may also be more apparent to herbivores. This suggests a potential trade-off between seasonal phenology and susceptibility to herbivory. To evaluate this hypothesis, we monitored the emergence and growth of 12 focal species (six each native and exotic) in monoculture and polyculture, while experimentally excluding generalist herbivores both early and later in the growing season. Consistent with past studies, the exotic species emerged earlier than native species. Regardless of species origin, earlier-emerging species achieved greater biomass by the end of the experiment, but were more negatively impacted by herbivory, particularly in the early part of the growing season. This greater impact of early-season herbivory on early-active species led to a reduction in the competitive advantage of exotic species growing in polyculture, and improved the performance of later-emerging natives. Such a trade-off between early growth and susceptibility to herbivores could be an important force in community assembly in seasonal herbaceous-dominated ecosystems. These results also show how herbivore exclusion favors early-active exotic species in this system, with important implications for management in many areas invaded by early-active exotic species.},

abstract = {The ability of various ecosystems to perform vital functions such as biodiversity production, and water, energy and nutrient cycling depends on the ecosystem state, i.e. health. Ecosystem state assessment has been a topic of intense research, but has reached a point at which accurate large scale (e.g. regional to global scale) modelling and monitoring are hindered by limitations in conventional assessment methods such as direct field sampling, modelling from environmental drivers such as temperature, precipitation and available nutrients, and modelling from remote sensing data. The Ecosystem-Earth Observation (Eco-EO) research group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), South Africa has highlighted the need in remote sensing research for an integrated sensing approach at the systems level. This perspective is based on the assumption that a modelling approach that exploits the strength of the various techniques (in situ environmental variables, direct field observation and remote sensing data) could potentially improve the assessment of ecosystem state at various geographic scales. In this light, the Eco-EO research group has embarked on an agro-system state assessment project since 2007 as a first step towards the implementation of the integrated modelling approach for various ecosystems. The agro-system consists of a monoculture forest plantation of Eucalyptus grandis situated in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This paper presents preliminary results from the KwaZulu-Natal E. grandis experimental study.},

abstract = {Wetlands provide many ecosystem services to society, most notably the provision of habitat for important plants and animals, the improvement of water quality, and the sequestration of carbon. Nitrogen and phosphorus budgets, vegetation structure and function, and carbon fluxes and accumulation are described for a pair of 1-ha created riverine wetlands in central Ohio USA over 20 years (1994-2013) of primary succession. The primary inflow to these experimental wetlands was from water pumped from the adjacent fourth-order Olentangy River. The pumping rate maintained for most of the years (an exception was a two-year comparison of pulsing and non-pulsing hydrology in the two wetlands in 2004-2005) was according to a pre-determined formula based on river stage. The pumped inflow to the wetlands averaged 38.7±1.5myr-1with precipitation averaging 1.1myr-1for the same years. Surface outflow averaged 27.1±1.4myr-1and subsurface seepage was estimated to be 13.2±0.2myr-1over that period. Both outflows returned water to the Olentangy River via surface and subsurface pathways respectively.Wetland plant richness increased from 13 species initially planted in one of the wetlands to 116 species overall after 17 years, with most of that richness (99 species) occurring in the first 5 years. The planted wetland had higher community diversity every year except one over 20 years while the naturally colonizing wetland was more productive especially in the first 7 years and overall still had 2000. kg more organic matter input by ANPP after 17 years than did the planted wetland.Nutrient mass inflows to the wetlands averaged 5.61±0.30 g-Pm-2yr-1(n=30 wetland years) for total phosphorus, 2.17±0.27g-Pm-2yr-1(n=30 wetland years) for soluble reactive phosphorus, 122±3g-Nm-2yr-1(n=14 wetland years) for total nitrogen, and 100±5g-Nm-2yr-1(n=32 wetland years) for nitrate-nitrogen. Retention rates were 2.40±0.23g-Pm-2yr-1for total phosphorus, 0.87±0.10g-Pm-2yr-1for soluble reactive phosphorus, 38.8±2.2g-Nm-2yr-1for total nitrogen, and 15.6±2.7g-Nm-2yr-1for nitrate-nitrogen. Total phosphorus retention was higher in the planted wetland compared to the natural colonizing wetland (44.3±4.4{\%} vs. 38.8±5.3{\%} respectively; p=0.059) while total nitrogen retention was significantly higher in the naturally colonizing wetland compared to the planted wetland (32.1±2.0{\%} vs. 28.4±2.6{\%} respectively; p=0.000085). Investigation of trends of water quality improvement showed that, overall, nutrient retention decreased from the beginning of the study through the 17th year in 2010. More recent trends showed tendencies for water quality improvement in 9 out of 11 of the nutrient parameters and time periods investigated between 2003 and 2010.The wetlands were effective carbon sinks, with rates of carbon sequestration (219-267g-Cm-2yr-1, higher than those measured in a reference natural flow-through wetland. Both carbon sequestration and methane emissions have been consistently higher in the naturally colonizing wetland, theorized as due to the greater productivity of this wetland over several years in the middle of this study.},

abstract = {The symbiotic microbes that grow in and on many organisms can play important roles in protecting their hosts from pathogen infection. While species diversity has been shown to influence community function in many other natural systems, the question of how species diversity of host-associated symbiotic microbes contributes to pathogen resistance is just beginning to be explored. Understanding diversity effects on pathogen resistance could be particularly helpful in combating the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) which has caused dramatic population declines in many amphibian species and is a major concern for amphibian conservation. Our study investigates the ability of host-associated bacteria to inhibit the proliferation of Bd when grown in experimentally assembled biofilm communities that differ in species number and composition. Six bacterial species isolated from the skin of Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae) were used to assemble bacterial biofilm communities containing 1, 2, 3, or all 6 bacterial species. Biofilm communities were grown with Bd for 7 days following inoculation. More speciose bacterial communities reduced Bd abundance more effectively. This relationship between bacterial species richness and Bd suppression appeared to be driven by dominance effects—the bacterial species that were most effective at inhibiting Bd dominated multi-species communities—and complementarity: multi-species communities inhibited Bd growth more than monocultures of constituent species. These results underscore the notion that pathogen resistance is an emergent property of microbial communities, a consideration that should be taken into account when designing probiotic treatments to reduce the impacts of infectious disease.},

abstract = {Green fa{\c{c}}ades can represent a sustainable solution for construction of new buildings and for retrofitting of existing buildings, in order to reduce the energy demands of the cooling systems, to mitigate the urban heat island and to improve the thermal energy performance of buildings. Green fa{\c{c}}ades can allow the physical shading of the building and promote evapotranspiration in summer, and increase the thermal insulation in winter. An experimental test was carried out at the University of Bari (Italy) for two years. Three vertical walls, made with perforated bricks, were tested: two were covered with evergreen plants (Pandorea jasminoides variegated and Rhyncospermum jasminoides) while the third wall was kept uncovered and used as control. Several climatic parameters concerning the walls and the ambient conditions were collected during the experimental test. The daylight temperatures observed on the shielded walls during warm days were lower than the respective temperatures of the uncovered wall up to 9.0 °C. The nighttime temperatures during the cold days for the vegetated walls were higher than the respective temperatures of the control wall up to 3.5 °C. The thermal effects of the facades at daytime was driven by solar radiation, wind velocity and air relative humidity. The highest cooling effect of such parameters occurred with a wind speed of 3–4 ms−1, an air relative humidity within the range 30–60{\%} and a solar radiation higher than 800 Wm−2. The long-term experimental test demonstrated that both Pandorea jasminoides variegated and Rhyncospermum jasminoides are suitable for green fa{\c{c}}ades in the Mediterranean climatic area. The results shown in the present research allow to fill the gap in literature concerning the lack of data for all the seasons of the year, in order to obtain a complete picture of the building thermal performance in the Mediterranean climate region.},

abstract = {Species diversity is a major determinant of ecosystem productivity, stability, invasibility, and nutrient dynamics. Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a high global priority.},

abstract = {The effect of plant diversity on aboveground organisms and processes was largely studied but there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the link between plant diversity and soil characteristics. Here, we analyzed the effect of plant identity and diversity on the diversity of extractible soil organic compounds (ESOC) using 87 experimental grassland plots with different levels of plant diversity and based on a pool of over 50 plant species. Two pools of low molecular weight organic compounds, LMW1 and LMW2, were characterized by GC-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. These pools include specific organic acids, fatty acids and phenolics, with more organic acids in LMW1 and more phenolics in LMW2. Plant effect on the diversity of LMW1 and LMW2 compounds was strong and weak, respectively. LMW1 richness observed for bare soil was lower than that observed for all planted soils; and the richness of these soil compounds increased twofold when dominant plant species richness increased from 1 to 6. Comparing the richness of LMW1 compounds observed for a range of plant mixtures and for plant monocultures of species present in these mixtures, we showed that plant species richness increases the richness of these ESOC mainly through complementarity effects among plant species associated with contrasted spectra of soil compounds. This could explain previously reported effects of plant diversity on the diversity of soil heterotrophic microorganisms.},

abstract = {Green roofs are an increasingly common, environmentally responsible building practice in the United States and abroad. They represent a new and growing market for the horticulture field, but require vegetation tolerant of harsh environmental conditions. Historically, Sedum species have been the most commonly used plants because, with proper species selection, they are tolerant of extreme temperatures, high winds, low fertility, and a limited water supply. A greenhouse study was conducted to determine how water availability influences growth and survival of a mixture of Sedum spp. on a green roof drainage system. Results indicate that substrate volumetric moisture content can be reduced to 0 m3 m3 within 1 day after watering depending on substrate depth and composition. Deeper substrates provided additional growth with sufficient water, but also required additional irrigation because of the higher evapotranspiration rates resulting from the greater biomass. Over the 88 day study, water was required at least once every 14 days to support growth in green roof substrates with a 2-cm media depth. However, substrates with a 6-cm media depth could do so with a watering only once every 28 days. Although vegetation was still viable after 88 days of drought, water should be applied at least once every 28 days for typical green roof substrates and more frequently for shal- lower substrates to sustain growth. The ability of Sedum to withstand extended drought conditions makes it ideal for shallow green roof systems.},

abstract = {Urban particulate pollution in the UK remains at levels which have the potential to cause negative impacts on human health. There is a need, therefore, for mitigation strategies within cities, especially with regards to vehicular sources. The use of vegetation as a passive filter of urban air has been previously investigated, however green roof vegetation has not been specifically considered. The present study aims to quantify the effectiveness of four green roof species - creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), red fescue (Festuca rubra), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and sedum (Sedum album) - at capturing particulate matter smaller than 10 $\mu$m (PM10). Plants were grown in a location away from major road sources of PM10and transplanted onto two roofs in Manchester city centre. One roof is adjacent to a major traffic source and one roof is characterised more by urban background inputs. Significant differences in metal containing PM10capture were found between sites and between species. Site differences were explained by proximity to major sources. Species differences arise from differences in macro and micro morphology of the above surface biomass. The study finds that the grasses, A. stolonifera and F. rubra, are more effective than P. lanceolata and S. album at PM10capture. Quantification of the annual PM10removal potential was calculated under a maximum sedum green roof installation scenario for an area of the city centre, which totals 325 ha. Remediation of 2.3{\%} (±0.1{\%}) of 9.18 tonnes PM10inputs for this area could be achieved under this scenario. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2. Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3. In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4. Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5. Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.},

Two experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity, and bloat potential. In Exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria (Streptococcus bovis strain 26, Prevotella ruminicola strain 23, Eubacterium ruminantium B1C23, Ruminococcus albus SY3, Fibrobacter succinogenes ssp. S85, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens C94) were used in vitro to determine the effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, VFA, and ruminal H2 and CH4 in mono or coculture with Methanobrevibacter smithii. The specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing soluble plant protein (3.27{\%} nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h incubation at 39 degrees C in Hungate tubes under a CO2 gas phase. A monoculture of M. smithii was grown similarly, except under H2:CO2 (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with soluble plant protein. In Exp. 2, 6 ruminally cannulated steers grazing wheat forage were used to evaluate the influence of bloat on the production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial biodiversity patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. In Exp. 1, cultures of R. albus (P {\textless} 0.01) and R. flavefaciens (P {\textless} 0.05) produced the most H2 among strains and resulted in greater (P {\textless} 0.01) CH4 production when cocultured with M. smithii than other coculture combinations. Cultures of S. bovis and E. ruminantium + M. smithii produced the most biofilm mass among strains. In Exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (P {\textless} 0.01). Biofilm production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (P {\textless} 0.01), and cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (P {\textless} 0.05) in the ruminal fluid were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing wheat forage. The molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA showed that 2 different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. Bloat in cattle grazing wheat pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.},

Moreover, positive effects of genotypic diversity were enhanced by the presence of deer, indicating a non-additive interaction between diversity and trophic-level complexity.

abstract = {Plantations of native timber species established on former pasture are a potential strategy to reduce the logging pressure on remnant natural forests in the tropics. Such plantations may help to mitigate or reverse the negative impacts of land degradation, and they may contribute to the long-term livelihood of livestock farmers. Planting native trees is, however, perceived as a risky activity due to limited knowledge of their performance and due to marked losses of newly established seedlings attributed to insect pests. Our study focuses on the small-scale effects of environmental heterogeneity, tree diversity and insecticide treatment on the performance of three native Central American timber species two years after establishment, and on damage inflicted by insect herbivores. Growth, survival and herbivore leaf damage were quantified for Anacardium excelsum (Anacardiaceae), Cedrela odorata (Meliaceae) and Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae) planted in an experiment in Panama as (1) monocultures, (2) mixed stands, and (3) mixed stands protected by insecticides. Our study revealed that small-scale effects can have a substantial impact on the success of timber trees planted on former pasture. Growth performance and survival of the three species was strongly affected by small-scale environmental heterogeneity, which was expressed as significant differences in growth and survival among different plantation plots at the same study site. Establishment of trees in mixed stands did not have significant effects on tree survival and growth compared to pure stands, although it reduced herbivore pressure in one of the studied tree species. All tree species grew best and suffered lowest leaf damage when protected by insecticides, indicating a general influence of insect herbivory on growth of newly established trees. In contrast to growth performance, survival was not significantly affected by different management practices or herbivory. The large variability among plots in tree survival and growth, and also in the effects of management practices such as planting design and insecticide treatment, emphasizes the importance of small-scale environmental heterogeneity on tree survival and growth. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of studying the joint structure of three data tables R, L and Q. In our motivating ecological example, the central table L is a sites-by-species table that contains the number of organisms of a set of species that occurs at a set of sites. At the margins of L are the sites-by-environment data table R and the species-by-trait data table Q. For relating the biological traits of organisms to the characteristics of the environment in which they live, we propose a statistical technique called RLQ analysis (R-mode linked to Q-mode), which consists in the general singular value decomposition of the triplet (R(t)D(I)LD(J)Q,D-q,D-p) where D-I, D-J, D-q, D-p are diagonal weight matrices, which are chosen in relation to the type of data that is being analyzed (quantitative, qualitative, etc.). In the special case where the central table is analysed by correspondence analysis, RLQ maximizes the covariance between linear combinations of columns of R and Q. An example in bird ecology illustrates the potential of this method for community ecologists.},

abstract = {Inputs of aboveground plant litter influence the abundance and activities of belowground decomposer biota. Litter-mixing studies have examined whether the diversity and heterogeneity of litter inputs affect decomposer communities in ways that can be predicted from monocultures. They have mainly attempted to detect non-additive effects of litter mixing, although individual species effects (additivity) as well as species interactions (non-additivity) may alter decomposition rates. To determine potential impacts of plant species loss on aboveground-decomposer linkages, we assessed both additive and non-additive effects of litter mixing on decomposer communities. A full-factorial litterbag experiment with leaves from four deciduous tree species was conducted, to assess responses of bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and microarthropods. Data were analyzed using a statistical method that first looked for additive effects based on the presence or absence of species and then any significant species interactions. We observed almost exclusively additive effects of all four litter species on decomposer biota, with each species exerting effects on different aspects of the community. These results imply that the consequences of species loss for the decomposer community will be largely predictable from knowledge of single species litter dynamics. The two species at opposite ends of the quality spectrum exerted the most effects. High-quality Liriodendron tulipifera supported a more diverse arthropod community and drove bottom-up effects on the decomposer food web. Low-quality Rhododendron maximum had negative effects on most groups of biota. Litter of mid-quality species exerted fewer effects. The influence of litter species richness on the Tylenchidae (nematodes) was the only non-additive effect of litter mixing. Together, these data demonstrate an effect of plant community composition on decomposer biomass, abundance, and diversity, confirming a link between above and belowground communities. We were able to identify the species to which the decomposer community is most sensitive, aiding predictions of the consequences of the loss of these dominant species on the decomposer community, with potential feedbacks for organic matter and nutrient turnover. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Reforestation and afforestation often takes place in the form of monocultures. These have increasingly come under criticism due to their greater susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions and pathogens and because of the negative long-term impacts they have on soil fertility. Moreover, reservations have frequently been expressed as to whether monoculture is the only way to maximize biomass productivity. Subtropical forests in China are not only rich in tree species but are also diverse in terms of topography. However, historical clear-cutting and the high demand for wood have meant that considerable areas of these forests have been degraded or lost entirely. In recent years, great efforts have been made in subtropical China to restore and afforest vast areas. Nonetheless, conifer monoculture plantations are still prevalent owing to the lack of data on the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and the limited knowledge of the growth performance of native broad-leaved tree species in plantations in this region. In this study, we investigated the growth response of individual tree saplings in a large-scale forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiment established in a highly heterogeneous environment in subtropical China (BEF-China). The experiment was established during the period November 2008 to April 2009 and incorporates a species pool of 24 tree species across 261 plots (0.067. ha each) and a broad richness gradient with 1-24 species per plot. Annual growth rates of tree height, stem diameter and crown width for 6723 saplings of 24 species in the third year after establishment were used as response variables. We analyzed the effects of initial size, local abiotic site conditions and local neighborhood on growth performance using mixed effects models. Initial size, local topographic (aspect, slope, curvature, elevation) and edaphic variables (total nitrogen, C/N ratio) as well as local neighborhood variables (competition index, Shannon index) were included as fixed effects. Random effects were plot and species identity. The results showed that growth performance of tree saplings was markedly species-specific and strongly affected by initial size and local site conditions. In this early stage of the experiment, local Shannon diversity did not yet explain a significant amount of variation in sapling growth. However, the significant effect of the increasing size of neighboring trees indicated that tree-tree interactions had already occurred. A greater investment in height growth at the expense of diameter growth suggested that light intercept is the priority for tree sapling growth. This study stresses the importance of better understanding the effects of local site conditions on initial growth in mixed-species plantations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The loss of plant species from terrestrial ecosystems may cause changes in soil decomposer communities and in decomposition of organic material with potential further consequences for other ecosystem processes. This was tested in experimental communities of 1, 2, 4, 8, 32 plant species and of 1, 2 or 3 functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous forbs). As plant species richness was reduced from the highest species richness to monocultures, mean aboveground plant biomass decreased by 150{\%}, but microbial biomass (measured by substrate induced respiration) decreased by only 15{\%} (P = 0.05). Irrespective of plant species richness, the absence of legumes (across diversity levels) caused microbial biomass to decrease by 15{\%} (P = 0.02). No effect of plant species richness or composition was detected on the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and no plant species richness effect was found on feeding activity of the mesofauna (assessed with a bait-lamina-test). Decomposition of cellulose and birchwood sticks was also not affected by plant species richness, but when legumes were absent, cellulose samples were decomposed more slowly (16{\%} in 1996, 27{\%} in 1997, P = 0.006). A significant decrease in earthworm population density of 63{\%} and in total earthworm biomass by 84{\%} was the single most prominent response to the reduction of plant species richness, largely due to a 50{\%} reduction in biomass of the dominant 'anecic' earthworms. Voles (Arvicola terrestris L.) also had a clear preference for high-diversity plots. Soil moisture during the growing season was unaffected by plant species richness or the number of functional groups present. In contrast, soil temperature was 2 K higher in monocultures compared with the most diverse mixtures on a bright day at peak season. We conclude that the lower abundance and activity of decomposers with reduced plant species richness was related to altered substrate quantity, a signal which is not reflected in rates of decomposition of standard test material. The presence of nitrogen fixers seemed to be the most important component of the plant diversity manipulation for soil heterotrophs. The reduction in plant biomass due to the simulated loss of plant species had more pronounced effects on voles and earthworms than on microbes, suggesting that higher trophic levels are more strongly affected than lower trophic levels.},

abstract = {Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) is a promising method of biomass production for energy purposes, but there have been concerns about the low diversity of these stands, including the risk for pest outbreaks. Mixing different clones has been advised as a way to tackle this problem and improve yields through positive diversity effects. Recent research into the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning supports these recommendations, but also raises worries about mechanisms that may confound results, such as a selection effect due to dominant clones outcompeting weaker ones. However, the few available studies on diversity effects in SRC plantations did not allow the disentangling of the mechanisms at play.We used data from an experimental SRC site, which incorporated three Swedish Salix clones in a row-based mixing design. Productivity was expected to be greater in mixtures and we attempted to elucidate whether this was due to a complementarity or a selection effect. We found that complementarity effects were generally larger than selection effects, yet the total diversity effect on yield was not significant. Leaf surface temperature measurements indicated that drought stress was unlikely to be the factor underlying this distorted diversity productivity relationship. We also found that a less-productive clone (Gudrun) had a different stem biomass distribution when in monoculture, which may have repercussions for the quality of the harvested product and points at a so far less recognized potential benefit of mixing.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that biological structures such as plant roots can have large impacts on landscape morphodynamics, and that physical models that do not incorporate biology can generate qualitatively incorrect predictions of sediment transport. However, work to date has focused almost entirely on the impacts of single, usually dominant, species. Here we ask whether multiple, coexisting species of hydropsychid caddisfly larvae have different impacts on sediment mobility compared to single-species systems due to competitive interactions and niche differences. We manipulated the presence of two common species of net-spinning caddisfly (Ceratopsyche oslari, Arctopsyche californica) in laboratory mesocosms and measured how their silk filtration nets influence the critical shear stress required to initiate sediment grain motion when they were in monoculture versus polyculture. We found that critical shear stress increases non-additively in polycultures where species were allowed to interact. Critical shear stress was 26{\%} higher in multi-species assemblages compared to the average single-species monoculture, and 21{\%} greater than levels of stability achieved by the species having the largest impact on sediment motion in monoculture. Supplementary behavioral experiments suggest the non-additive increase in critical shear stress may have occurred as competition among species led to shifts in the spatial distribution of the two populations and complementary habitat use. To explore the implications of these results for field conditions, we used results from the laboratory study to parameterize a common model of sediment transport. We then used this model to estimate potential bed movement in a natural stream for which we had measurements of channel geometry, grain size, and daily discharge. Although this extrapolation is speculative, it illustrates that multi-species impacts could be sufficiently large to reduce bedload sediment flux over annual time scales in streams where multiple species of caddisfly are present.},

abstract = {1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs. 2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH. 3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra. 4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a `plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic `leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.},
annote = {- Study looking at a possible leaf-stem-root coordination among seven different plant types in a subartic ecosystem.

- Overall, it seems like stem-leaf-coordination exists in this ecosystem. Suggests that abiotic and biotic pressures are similar in magnitude in both belowground and aboveground systems??

- Some comments
(1) P content wasn't intercorrelated across all plant organs, despite covarying with N
(2) It's pretty odd that the authors didn't include SRL in their trait space.
(3) Findings are constrained within a single spatial scale (local factors are king here; soil depth, biotic factors, succession, microtopography). Would we see the same patterns at a larger scale?
(4) Cool to see that aquatic plants are able to exhibit a PES, despite having different life-history strategies. E.g. stronger focus on anchorage as opposed to nutrient uptake},

abstract = {Both the presence and diversity of plants are integral to the development and functional abilities of microbial communities within constructed wetlands (CWs). The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of different individual and paired plant species combinations on microbial community function in HSSF mesocosm CWs. Experimental systems were quadruplicated and operated as two mesocosms in series planted with Phragmites australis (X) or Phalaris arundinacea (O), giving four possible sequential combinations (XX, XO, OX, OO). Wastewater was loaded each day into position 1 mesocosm with the outflow entering position 2 mesocosm, and the corresponding position 2 mesocosm outflow representing an overall experimental system effluent. The metabolic function of the interstitial-based microbial communities within each of the 16 mesocosm pairs was assessed at a single time point in the spring (May) based on community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) gathered using Biolog{\textregistered}EcoPlates. Microbial activity and metabolic richness (number of carbon sources utilised) were found to be higher in position 1 mesocosms compared to position two. Microbial community carbon source utilisation patterns (CSUPs), overall activity and metabolic richness were similar between all mesocosms from position 1-irrespective of plant species. When assessing microbial communities in position 2 of each pairing a greater variety of CSUPs, activities and metabolic richness' could be found suggesting the sequence and choice of plant can alter the microbial community function in the HSSF mesocosms. Of particular interest were the mesocosm/plant species combinations containing Phalaris in the position 2 which led to higher overall microbial activity and richness, distinct carbon source utilisation patterns (CSUPs) and an increased utilisation of specific carbon sources further from the inlet. More specifically the XO pairings (Phragmites-Phalaris) seemed to offer the most promising overall microbial function throughout both positions 1 and 2 in series suggesting plant diversity may help enhance microbial community function, and therefore microbial based water treatment capacity. The findings also suggest that the microbial communities associated with each plant species respond differently to factors such as nutrient availability, and although not yet clearly defined, further highlights the potential for improved or tailored water treatment in CWs through selection of specific plant species and combinations. Broader microbial community function or greater activity did not correlate with improved water treatment efficiency in this study. This may have been due to the relatively low contaminant loads utilised, or the limited amount of data collected. Further study across several seasons or with higher contaminant loads is recommended.},

However, recent approaches have been popularized that are without an evolutionary basis or an underlying null model. Here we highlight the limitations of such techniques in comparative analyses by using simulations to compare two commonly used comparative methods with and without evolutionary basis, respectively: generalized least squares (GLS) and phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR). We find that GLS methods are more efficient at estimating model parameters and produce lower variance in parameter estimates, lower phylogenetic signal in residuals, and lower Type I error rates than PVR methods. These results can very likely be generalized to eigenvector methods that control for space and both space and phylogeny. We highlight that GLS methods can be adapted in numerous ways and that the variance structure used in these models can be flexibly optimized to each data set.},

Three soil aggregate stability mea- sures (slaking, mechanical breakdown and micro- cracking) were considered in path analyses. Results Soil aggregate stability increased signifi- cantly from monocultures to plant species mixtures and in the presence of grasses, while it decreased in the presence of legumes, though effects differed somewhat between soil aggregate stability mea- sures. Using path analysis plant community effects could be explained by variations in root biomass, soil microbial biomass, soil organic carbon con- centrations (all positive relationships), and earth- worm biomass (negative relationship with mechan- ical breakdown). Conclusions The present study identified important drivers of plant community effects on soil aggregate stability. The effects of root biomass, soil microbial biomass, and soil organic carbon concentrations were largely consistent across plant diversity levels suggesting that the mechanisms identified are of gen- eral relevance.},

abstract = {Besides crops, agriculture supplies all three major categories of ecosystem services (ES). However, agriculture also supplies an array of ecosystem dis-services (EDS) that may harm other ecosystems. The flows of ES and EDS are directly dependent on the management of agricultural ecosystems. The traditional method of Chinese agriculture, which supports sustainable agriculture, has been proven to increase ES and reduce EDS. However, there is a lack of a detailed understanding of the ES and EDS associated with traditional agriculture, and also of differences between traditional and modern agriculture. In this study, an investigation was conducted on the ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem dis-services (EDS) of traditional and modern agriculture in Congjiang County, Guizhou Province, China. Afterwards, the economic values of ES and EDS were quantified experimentally and calculated based on the market price. The results show that: the net economic value of traditional rice-fish agriculture was 3.31×10 4 CNY{\textperiodcentered}ha -1 (6.83 CNY = 1 USD as of July, 2009) and that of rice monoculture was 1.99×10 4 CNY{\textperiodcentered}ha -1. Significant differences existed between traditional rice-fish and rice monoculture fields for their economic values of some ES or EDS. A benefit and cost analysis (BCA) model was used to adjust the conflict between the economic income and environmental loss from traditional and modern agriculture. The BCA model not only calculates the net income but also monetizes the EDS of the agricultural systems. The results showed that the net income of rice-fish agriculture was 1.94×10 4 CNY{\textperiodcentered}ha -1 higher than that of rice monoculture. However, the benefit to cost ratio (BCR) of rice-fish agriculture was lower than that of rice monoculture, indicating that the traditional agricultural model was not the most optimized choice for farmers. The value of the rice-fish agriculture was much higher than that of the rice monoculture. Thus, when considering the benefits that rice-fish agriculture contributes to the largescale society, these agricultural methods needs to be utilized.

abstract = {Summary There is a growing interest amongst community ecologists in functional traits. Response traits determine membership in communities. Effect traits influence ecosystem function. One goal of community ecology is to predict the effect of environmental change on ecosystem function. Environmental change can directly and indirectly affect ecosystem function. Indirect effects are mediated through shifts in community structure. It is difficult to predict how environmental change will affect ecosystem function via the indirect route when the change in effect trait distribution isnotpredictablefromthechangeinresponse trait distribution.Whenresponse traits function as effect traits, however, it becomes possible to predict the indirect effect of environmental change on ecosystem function. Here we illustrate four examples in which key attributes of ectomycorrhizal fungi function as both response and effect traits. While plant ecologists have discussed response and effect traits in the context of community structuring and ecosystem function, this approach has not been applied to ectomycorrhizal fungi. This is unfortunate because of the large effects of ectomycorrhizal fungi on ecosystem function. We hopeto stimulate further research in this area in thehopeof better predicting the ecosystem-and landscape-level effects of the fungi as influenced by changing environmental conditions.

abstract = {While the positive role of macrophytes on removal efficiency in constructed wetlands has been well established, possible differences in performance between plants species of comparable life forms and sizes are much harder to demonstrate. We reviewed 35 experimental studies published in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings on the effect of macrophyte species selection on pollutant removal in SSFCW. The studies cover a wide range of macrophyte species, experimental approaches (from well-replicated microcosm experiments to comparison between full full-size constructed wetlands), climatic conditions (from tropical to cold-temperate) and types of effluent (domestic, industrial, etc.). Frequent methodological limitations in these studies compel caution in the interpretation of their results. Yet, the fact that the majority found some (occasionally large) differences in efficiency between plant species for one or more type of pollutant suggests that macrophyte species selection does matter. However, there is little generalization to be made that could help guide species selection for SSFCW, except for the exact conditions in which the experiments were done. For example, the same pair of species that was tested in different studies occasionally gave opposite results in terms of which one performs best. Also, most studies provided few insights on the mechanisms or plant properties that could explain the observed differences in plant species efficiency. Finally, we discuss other relevant research questions and approaches that could help better guide macrophyte species selection for CW. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The harsh and stressful growing environment of extensive green roofs means that only a limited range of plant species is routinely used. However, ecological theory suggests that highly diverse or species-rich vegetation might be more resistant and resilient to severe environmental stress. This paper describes an experiment investigating the influence of vegetation diversity on green roof plant survival following an imposed drought. Twelve species were selected from the three major taxonomic and functional plant groups that are commonly used for extensive green roofs (forbs, sedums and grasses). Four species were chosen from each group and planted in combinations of increasing diversity and complexity: monocultures, four-species mixtures and twelve-species mixtures. Three watering regimes were imposed: wet, moderate and dry (watering every 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks, respectively). It was concluded that a diverse plant mix was more advantageous than a monoculture in terms of greater survivability and higher visual rating under dry conditions. It was shown that combinations of species differing in functional diversity and complexity achieved this more effectively compared to plants of the same taxonomic group that compete for resources when grown together. Drought tolerance in sedums was superior to that in forbs and grasses. Little difference in drought tolerance was observed between forbs and grasses, which must be watered before reaching a permanent wilting point. Plants that exhibited over 50{\%} leaf desiccation were unable to survive to the end of the study. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In many systems, native communities are being replaced by novel exotic-dominated ones. We experimentally compared species diversity decline between nine-species grassland communities under field conditions to test whether diversity maintenance mechanisms differed between communities containing all exotic or all native species using a pool of 40 species. Aboveground biomass was greater in exotic than native plots, and this difference was larger in mixtures than in monocultures. Species diversity declined more in exotic than native communities and declines were explained by different mechanisms. In exotic communities, overyielding species had high biomass in monoculture and diversity declined linearly as this selection effect increased. In native communities, however, overyielding species had low biomass in monoculture and there was no relationship between the selection effect and diversity decline. This suggests that, for this system, yielding behaviour is fundamentally different between presumably co-evolved natives and coevolutionarily naive exotic species, and that native-exotic status is important to consider.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Hoeber, Fransson, Prieto-Ruiz, Manzoni and Weih. Individual plant species or genotypes often differ in their demand for nutrients; to compete in a community they must be able to acquire more nutrients (i.e., uptake efficiency) and/or use them more efficiently for biomass production than their competitors. These two mechanisms are often complementary, as there are inherent trade-offs between them. In a mixed-stand, species with contrasting nutrient use patterns interact and may use their resources to increase productivity in different ways. Under contrasting nutrient availabilities, the competitive advantages conferred by either strategy may also shift, so that the interaction between resource use strategy and resource availability ultimately determines the performance of individual genotypes in mixtures. The aim was to investigate growth and nitrogen (N) use efficiency of two willow (Salix) genotypes grown in monoculture and mixture in a fertilizer contrast. We explored the hypotheses that (1) the biomass production of at least one of the involved genotypes should be greater when grown in mixture as compared to the corresponding monoculture when nutrients are the most growth-limiting factor; and (2) the N economy of individual genotypes differs when grown in mixture compared to the corresponding monoculture. The genotypes ‘Tora' (Salix schwerinii × S. viminalis) and ‘Loden' (S. dasyclados), with contrasting phenology and functional traits, were grown from cuttings in a growth container experiment under two nutrient fertilization treatments (high and low) in mono- and mixed-culture for 17 weeks. Under low nutrient level, ‘Tora' showed a higher biomass production (aboveground biomass, leaf area productivity) and N uptake efficiency in mixture than in monoculture, whereas ‘Loden' showed the opposite pattern. In addition, ‘Loden' showed higher leaf N productivity but lower N uptake efficiency than ‘Tora.' The results demonstrated that the specific functional trait combinations of individual genotypes affect their response to mixture as compared to monoculture. Plants grown in mixture as opposed to monoculture may thus increase biomass and vary in their response of N use efficiency traits. However, young plants were investigated here, and as we cannot predict mixture response in mature stands, our results need to be validated at field scale.},

abstract = {Human activities affect both tree species composition and diversity in forested ecosystems. This in turn alters the species diversity of plant litter and litter quality, which may have cascading effects on soil microbial communities and their functions for decomposition and nutrient cycling. We tested microbial responses to litter species diversity in a leaf litter decomposition experiment including monocultures, 2-, and 4-species mixtures in the subtropical climate zone of southeastern China. Soil microbial community composition was assessed by lipid analysis, and microbial functions were measured using extracellular enzyme activity and gross rates of nitrogen mineralization. We observed a positive relationship between litter species diversity and abundances of mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes. Alternatively, enzyme activities involved in carbon and phosphorus acquisition, and enzyme indices of relative carbon limitation, were higher only in the 4-species mixtures. This suggests that the minimum basal substrate level for enzyme production was reached, or that limitation was higher, at the highest diversity level only. Responses to litter diversity also changed over time, where phosphatase responses to litter diversity were strongest early in decomposition and the indices of carbon limitation relative to other nutrients showed stronger responses later in decomposition. Enzyme activities were related to lipid biomarker data and the mass of litter remaining at the third time point, but relationships between enzyme activity and the mass of litter remaining were not consistent across other time points. We conclude that litter species richness will likely only reduce microbial functions at key intervals of diversity loss while microbial growth is more sensitive to incremental diversity loss, with no clear relationships between them or to ecosystem functions. The observed litter diversity effects on soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity indicate interactions of aboveground and belowground communities, and together with environmental conditions they are important for maintaining ecosystem functions. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract = {Deterministic niche-based processes have been proposed to explain species relative abundance within communities but lead to different predictions: habitat filtering (HF) predicts dominant species to exhibit similar traits while niche differentiation (ND) requires that species have dissimilar traits to coexist. Using a multiple trait-based approach, we evaluated the relative roles of HF and ND in determining species abundances in productive grasslands. Four dimensions of the functional niche of 12 co-occurring grass species were identified using 28 plant functional traits. Using this description of the species niche, we investigated patterns of functional similarity and dissimilarity and linked them to abundance in randomly assembled six-species communities subjected to fertilization/disturbance treatments. Our results suggest that HF and ND jointly determined species abundance by acting on contrasting niche dimensions. The effect of HF decreased relative to ND with increasing disturbance and decreasing fertilization. Dominant species exhibited similar traits in communities whereas dissimilarity favored the coexistence of rare species with dominants by decreasing inter-specific competition. This stabilizing effect on diversity was suggested by a negative relationship between species over-yielding and relative abundance. We discuss the importance of considering independent dimensions of functional niche to better understand species abundance and coexistence within communities.},

We expect that ecologically-managed tree monocultures, however, can help to mitigate this impact. Here, we carried out an experiment with Inga vera (Fabaceae), an extrafloral nectary bearing plant, to test if the efficiency of ants as anti-herbivory defense is affected by the replacement of its natural habitat (Araucaria Forest) by ecologically-managed tree monocultures (plantations of Araucaria, Pinus, and Eucalyptus). Seedlings of Inga vera were transplanted to three patches of each habitat and ants were excluded from half of the plants. The abundance of ants and herbivores was low, similar among habitats, and exhibited temporal asynchrony. Number of herbivores and accumulated herbivory levels were lower in plant with ants. Rates of herbivory were extremely low and lower for young leaves than for mature leaves. The presence of ants did not affect plant performance traits measured by their growth in height, and their final numbers of leaves and leaflets. Contrary to what might be expected, ant-protected plants produced fewer leaves and leaflets than unprotected ones. In conclusion, Inga vera-ant interaction was similar between its natural habitat and the tree monocultures, indicating that potentially both species diversity and ecological processes can be conserved in ecologically-managed tree monocultures.

abstract = {Changes in plant community structure, including the loss of plant diversity may affect soil microbial communities. To test this hypothesis, plant diversity and composition were experimentally varied in grassland plots cultivated with monocultures or mixtures of 2, 3 or 4 species. We tested the effects of monocultures versus mixtures and of plant species composition on culturable soil bacterial activity, number of substrates used and catabolic diversity, microbial biomass N, microbial respiration, and root biomass. These properties were all measured 10 months after seeding the experiment. Soil bacterial activity, number of substrates used and catabolic diversity were measured in the different plant communities using BIOLOG GN and GP microplates, which are redox-based tests measuring capacity of soil culturable bacteria to use a variety of organic substrates. Microbial biomass N, microbial respiration, and root biomass were insensitive to plant diversity. Culturable soil microbial activity, substrates used and diversity declined with declining plant diversity. Their activity, number of substrates used and diversity were significantly higher in plots with 3 and 4 plant species than in monocultures and in plots with 2 species. There was also an effect of plant species composition. Culturable soil microbial activity and diversity was higher in the four-species plant community than in any of the plant monocultures suggesting that the effect of plant diversity could not be explained by the presence of a particular plant species. Our results showed that changes in plant diversity and composition in grassland ecosystems lead to a rapid response of bacterial activity and diversity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The generation of energy from biomass of extensive, high-diversity grasslands can be an alternative to their abandonment, and anaerobic digestion is one possible method for converting grassland biomass into energy. However, little is known about the effects of species richness (SR) and functional groups on chemical constituents relevant for anaerobic digestion and the resulting energy potential. In this study, changes in the herbage chemical constituents that are relevant for forage quality were studied along a well-defined diversity gradient (one to sixty species) and across different combinations of functional groups (legumes, small herbs, tall herbs and grasses). Substrate-specific methane yield (CH4 sub) was estimated through the concentrations of forage-quality parameters such as crude fibre (CF), crude protein (CP), crude lipid, nitrogen-free extract and their documented digestibility values, as well as the respective methane yields. Results show that with increasing SR, the CF increased and CP decreased, even though these effects could not be fully disentangled from the presence of grasses. These trends led to a negative effect of SR on CH4 sub, while the area-specific methane yield (CH4 area = CH4 sub × biomass yield) increased due to a strong increase in biomass with increasing SR. The CH4 sub was increased when legumes were present, and it declined with the presence of grasses. Generally, CH4 sub and CH4 area varied between functional-group monocultures and all functional-group mixtures.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the growth, community structure, and nutrient removal rates between monoculture and mixed wetlands, based on the hypothesis that it depends on the plant species used in the wetlands as to whether monoculture or mixed wetland is superior in plant growth and nutrient removal. Pilot-scale monoculture and mixed constructed wetlands were studied over 4 years. The monoculture wetland had a community height similar to the mixed wetland during the early years but a significantly lower height than the mixed wetland (P{\textless}0.05) during the last year. The mixed wetland also displayed a higher plant density than the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The leaf area index in the monoculture wetland was significantly higher in the first year (P{\textless}0.05) and significantly lower in the later years (P{\textless}0.05) than that in the mixed wetland. The monoculture wetland had a similar vertical distribution of below-ground biomass over 4 years, while the mixed wetland showed a significant change in vertical distribution of below-ground biomass in the last 2 years. The monoculture wetland had a larger (P{\textless}0.05) above-ground biomass and a similar leaf biomass in the first year, and a smaller above-ground biomass (P{\textless}0.05) and a smaller leaf biomass (P{\textless}0.05) than the mixed wetland during the latter 2 years. The amount of standing dead mass was smaller in the mixed wetland than in the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The mixed wetland exhibited a significantly lower NH4-N removal rate in the first year (P{\textless}0.05), and significantly higher NH4-N removal rate in the last year, when compared to the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The study indicated that species competition and stubble growth resulted in significant differences between monoculture and mixed constructed wetlands in plant growth, community structure, and nutrient removal rates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

As green roofs become more common in cities, an understanding of the potential positive and negative impacts of widespread use of this exotic but useful plant is needed. In this study we sampled bees visiting a green roof in downtown Toronto and compared the proportion of Sedum pollen in the loads they were carrying back to nesting locations. It was found that smaller bees (e.g. Lasioglossum, Hylaeus) were significantly less common on the roof compared with medium (e.g. Apis, Megachile) and large-sized bees (e.g. Bombus, Andrena). The proportion of Sedum pollen in the pollen loads of foraging bees collected was high amongst all bees (average of 80.5 {\%} of total pollen load), but significantly greater for exotic bees compared to native bees. Moreover, native bees had significantly greater numbers of non-Sedum pollen types comprising more than {\textgreater}20 {\%} of their pollen loads, meaning bees could be visiting flowers at ground level and on the roof in the same foraging bout. As the number of green roofs in cities increase, the characteristics of their designs, including the vegetation type and diversity, could have a significant impact in shaping local urban bee communities.},

abstract = {General principles from coexistence theory are often invoked to explain how and why mixtures of species outperform monocultures. However, the complementarity and selection effects commonly measured in biodiversity experiments do not precisely quantify the niche and relative fitness differences that govern species coexistence. Given this lack of direct correspondence, how can we know whether species-rich mixtures are stable and that the benefits of diversity will therefore persist? We develop a resource-based included-niche model in which plant species have asymmetric access to a nested set of belowground resource pools. We use the model to show that positive complementarity effects arise from stabilising niche differences, but do not necessarily lead to stable coexistence and hence can be transient. In addition, these transient complementarity effects occur in the model when there is no complementary resource use among species. Including a trade-off between uptake rates and the size of the resource pool stabilised interactions and led to persistent complementarity coupled with weak or negative selection effects, consistent with results from the longest-running field biodiversity experiments. We suggest that future progress requires a greater mechanistic understanding of the links between ecosystem functions and their underlying biological processes.},

abstract = {Aims Fine roots play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of terrestrial ecosystems and are vital for understanding forest ecosystem functioning and services. Higher plant species diversity has been largely reported to increase aboveground community biomass, but how biodiversity affects fine-root production and the related mechanisms in forests remain unclear. In this study, we aim to answer two questions: (i) does fine-root production increase with tree species richness? (ii) Can this effect be explained by niche complementarity among species? Methods We analyzed data from a large forest biodiversity experiment (BEF-China) with 5-year-old trees. Fine-root growth was measured as standing biomass and annual fine-root regrowth was estimated using ingrowth cores. Moreover, relative yield was calculated to test whether over-or under-yielding occurred when mixtures were compared with the average monoculture of the species included in the mixtures. We calculated functional diversity for fine-root ({\textless}= 2 mm in diameter) traits by Rao's quadratic entropy index for each species mixture. The effects of manipulated tree species richness and identity on fine-root traits were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Mixed models were also used to test the relationships between tree species richness and fine-root standing biomass, annual regrowth and vertical heterogeneity. Important Findings Fine roots of more than one species were found in half of the soil cores in mixtures indicating that belowground interactions in these young forest stands occurred much earlier than canopy closure. We found significant differences among species in fine-root traits such as diameter and specific root length (SRL), which suggested different resource-use strategies and niche partitioning among species. Mean fine-root diameter of species ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 mm, mean SRL ranged from 12.43 m.g(-1) to 70.22 m.g(-1) and mean vertical distribution index beta ranged from 0.68 to 0.93. There was a significant positive relationship between species richness and the evenness of the vertical distribution of fine-root standing biomass. Moreover, marginally significant positive relationships existed between species richness and standing biomass as well as annual regrowth of fine roots. Relative yields and Rao's quadratic entropy index were both not significantly affected by species richness. However, the relative yield of fine-root standing biomass was marginally correlated with Rao's quadratic entropy index, implying that belowground niche complementarity between species does contribute to diversity effects. In conclusion, our study showed positive effects of species richness on the filling of soil volume by fine roots in the studied experimental forest communities. This has positive effects on fine-root standing biomass and may also lead to increased aboveground biomass.},

abstract = {Aims Many experiments have shown a positive effect of species richness on productivity in grassland plant communities. However, it is poorly understood how environmental conditions affect this relationship. We aimed to test whether deep soil and limiting nutrient conditions increase the complementarity effect (CE) of species richness due to enhanced potential for resource partitioning. Methods We grew monocultures and mixtures of four common grassland species in pots on shallow and deep soil, factorially combined with two nutrient levels. Soil volume was kept constant to avoid confounding soil depth and volume. Using an additive partitioning method, we separated biodiversity effects on plant productivity into components due to species complementarity and dominance. Important findings Net biodiversity and complementarity effects were consistently higher in shallow pots, which was unexpected, and at the low nutrient level. These two results suggest that although belowground partitioning of resources was important, especially under low nutrient conditions, it was not due to differences in rooting depths. We conclude that in our experiment (i) horizontal root segregation might have been more important than the partitioning of rooting depths and (ii) that the positive effects of deep soil found in other studies were due to the combination of deeper soil with larger soil Volume.},

abstract = {Species richness of plant communities has been demonstrated to provide resistance to invasion by unsown species, though the relationship with resource availability varies between studies. The present work involved five grassland species grown in monocultures and in four-species mixtures sown in accordance with a simplex design. The species used represented different functional groups (i.e. grasses, legumes and non-N(2)-fixing species), each of which differed internally in terms of competitiveness. I hypothesized that sown diversity would negatively affect invader performance by decreasing the availability of light and soil nitrogen (N) for invading species, and that functional composition of the sown diversity would affect the functional composition of the invading flora. The experimental plots were harvested for two years, and were fertilized with 100 kg N ha(-1) each year. The number of unsown species (classified into four functional groups) invading each plot and their proportion of the biomass harvested were recorded. The penetration of incoming light through the canopy, the apparent N uptake by the sown species from the soil, and the mineral N content in the soil were measured. I found that diverse communities captured more resources both above- and belowground, and the number of invading species and their biomass production were smaller in mixed than in monoculture plots. However, the sampling effect of one grass was also strong. These results suggest that increased resource use in diverse communities can reduce invasion.},

abstract = {Increased incidence of drought, as predicted under climate change, has the potential to negatively affect grassland production. Compared to monocultures, vertical belowground niche complementarity between shallow- and deep-rooting species may be an important mechanism resulting in higher yields and higher resistance to drought in grassland mixtures. However, very little is known about the belowground responses in grassland systems and increased insight into these processes may yield important information both to predict the effect of future climate change and better design agricultural systems to cope with this. This study assessed the effect of a 9-week experimental summer drought on the depth of water uptake of two shallow-rooting species (Lolium perenne L. and Trifolium repens L.) and two deep-rooting species (Cichorium intybus L. and Trifolium pratense L.) in grassland monocultures and four-species mixtures by using the natural abundance $\delta$18O isotope method. We tested the following three hypotheses: (1) drought results in a shift of water uptake to deeper soil layers, (2) deep-rooting species take up a higher proportion of water from deeper soil layers relative to shallow-rooting species, and (3) as a result of interspecific interactions in mixtures, the water uptake of shallow-rooting species becomes shallower when grown together with deep-rooting species and vice versa, resulting in reduced niche overlap. The natural abundance $\delta$18O technique provided novel insights into the depth of water uptake of deep- and shallow- rooting grassland species and revealed large shifts in depth of water uptake in response to drought and interspecific interactions. Compared to control conditions, drought reduced the proportional water uptake from 0–10 cm soil depth (PCWU0–10) of L. perenne, T. repens and C. intybus in monocultures by on average 54{\%}. In contrast, the PCWU0–10 of T. pratense in monoculture increased by 44{\%}, and only when grown in mixture did the PCWU0–10 of T. pratense decrease under drought conditions. In line with hypothesis (2), in monoculture, the PCWU0–10 of shallow-rooting species L. perenne and T. repens was 0.53 averaged over the two drought treatments, compared to 0.16 for the deep-rooting C. intybus. Surprisingly, in monoculture, water uptake by T. pratense was shallower than for the shallow-rooting species (PCWU0–10 = 0.68). Interspecific interactions in mixtures resulted in a shift in the depth of water uptake by the different species. As hypothesised, the shallow-rooting species L. perenne and T. repens tended to become shallower, and the deep-rooting T. pratense made a dramatic shift to deeper soil layers (reduction in PCWU0–10 of 58{\%} on average) in mixture compared to monoculture. However, these shifts did not result in a reduction in the proportional similarity of the proportional water uptake from different soil depth intervals (niche overlap) in mixtures compared to monocultures. There was no clear link between interspecific differences in depth of water uptake and the reduction of biomass production under drought compared to control conditions (drought resistance). Cichorium intybus, the species with water uptake from the deepest soil layers was one of the species most affected by drought. Interestingly, T. pratense, which was least affected by drought, also had the greatest plasticity in depth of water uptake. This suggests that there may be an indirect effect of rooting depth on drought resistance, as it determines the potential plasticity in the depth of water uptake.},

abstract = {Species richness has been shown to increase biomass production of plant communities. Such overyielding occurs when a community performs better than its component monocultures due to the complementarity or dominance effect and is mostly detected in substrate-bound plant communities (terrestrial plants or submerged macrophytes) where resource use complementarity can be enhanced due to differences in rooting architecture and depth. Here, we investigated whether these findings are generalizeable for free-floating phytoplankton with little potential for spatial differences in resource use. We performed aquatic microcosm experiments with eight phytoplankton species belonging to four functional groups to determine the manner in which species and community biovolume varies in relation to the number of functional groups and hypothesized that an increasing number of functional groups within a community promotes overyielding. Unexpectedly, we did not detect overyielding in any algal community. Instead, total community biovolume tended to decrease with an increasing number of functional groups. This underyielding was mainly caused by the negative dominance effect that originated from a trade-off between growth rate and final biovolume. In monoculture, slow-growing species built up higher biovolumes than fast-growing ones, whereas in mixture a fast-growing but low-productive species monopolized most of the nutrients and prevented competing species from developing high biovolumes expected from monocultures. Our results indicated that the magnitude of the community biovolume was largely determined by the identity of one species. Functional diversity and resource use complementarity were of minor importance among free-floating phytoplankton, possibly reflecting the lack of spatially heterogeneous resource distribution. As a consequence, biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships may not be easily generalizeable from substrate-bound plant to phytoplankton communities and vice versa.},

abstract = {In nature, ecological balance is maintained by biodiversity through a stable food-web. This concept has been adopted to integrated pest management in organic crop production to conserve natural enemies. However, trials are needed to find an appropriate cropping regime and the coincided field management for a specific crop and the dynamic relations of the pests and natural enemies under the conservation practices need to be clarified. Therefore, in the present study, with a relay-intercropping regime as a strategy to enrich field vegetation diversity and habitat improvement by plant residual mulching as a strategy to enrich field fauna diversity, a cabbage crop experiment was conducted to monitor the population dynamics of pests and native natural enemies and to confirm the effectiveness of relay-intercropping and plant residual mulching in natural enemies conservation and the consequent biological pest control. A summer cabbage was intercropped with tomato, and plant residues were mulched on the soil surface as the habitat for natural enemies. During the growth period of crops, the density of Lepidoptera larvae and three kind of predators including frog, spider and carabid were examined and analyzed with mathematic model as P 1 = P B1 + {\{}P max -P B1 -P Y1 [1-$\beta$ 1 (t-$\tau$) 2 ]{\}}EXP[-$\alpha$ 1 (t-$\tau$) 2 ] +P Y1 [1-$\beta$ 1 (t-$\tau$)2] (t ≤$\tau$) and P 2 = P B2 +{\{}P max -P B2 -P Y2 [1-$\beta$ 2 (t-$\tau$) 2 ]{\}}EXP [-$\alpha$ 2 (t-$\tau$) 2 ]+P Y2 [1-$\beta$ 2 (t-$\tau$) 2 ] (t≥$\tau$). The density of pests was lower in intercropping plots than in mono-cultured plots and lower in plots with habitat management than in those without. The density of natural enemies was higher in intercropping plots than in mono-cultured plots and higher in plots with habitat management than in those without. The damage index of cabbage and tomato was proportional to population density of pests. It was concluded that tomato as a shelter crop lowered the risk of pest incidence in the intercropped cabbage crop and residual mulching as habitat management in the crop field could favour natural enemies to control pest insects.},

abstract = {There is considerable evidence that both plant diversity and plant identity can influence the level of predation and predator abundance aboveground. However, how the level of predation in the soil and the abundance of predatory soil fauna are related to plant diversity and identity remains largely unknown. In a biodiversity field experiment, we examined the effects of plant diversity and identity on the infectivity of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs, Heterorhabditis and Steinernema spp.), which prey on soil arthropods, and abundance of carnivorous non-EPNs, which are predators of other nematode groups. To obtain a comprehensive view of the potential prey/food availability, we also quantified the abundance of soil insects and nonpredatory nematodes and the root biomass in the experimental plots. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate possible pathways by which plant diversity and identity may affect EPN infectivity and the abundance of carnivorous non-EPNs. Heterorhabditis spp. infectivity and the abundance of carnivorous non-EPNs were not directly related to plant diversity or the proportion of legumes, grasses and forbs in the plant community. However, Steinernema spp. infectivity was higher in monocultures of Festuca rubra and Trifolium pratense than in monocultures of the other six plant species. SEM revealed that legumes positively affected Steinernema infectivity, whereas plant diversity indirectly affected the infectivity of HeterorhabditisEPNs via effects on the abundance of soil insects. The abundance of prey (soil insects and root-feeding, bacterivorous, and fungivorous nematodes) increased with higher plant diversity. The abundance of prey nematodes was also positively affected by legumes. These plant community effects could not be explained by changes in root biomass. Our results show that plant diversity and identity effects on belowground biota (particularly soil nematode community) can differ between organisms that belong to the same feeding guild and that generalizations about plant diversity effects on soil organisms should be made with great caution.},

abstract = {AimsThe relationship between biodiversity and ecological stability is a long-standing issue in ecology. Current diversity-stability studies, which have largely focused on species diversity, often report an increase in the stability of aggregate community properties with increasing species diversity. Few studies have examined the linkage between phylogenetic diversity, another important dimension of biodiversity, and stability. By taking species evolutionary history into account, phylogenetic diversity may better capture the diversity of traits and niches of species in a community than species diversity and better relate to temporal stability. In this study, we investigated whether phylogenetic diversity could affect temporal stability of community biomass independent of species diversity. MethodsWe performed an experiment in laboratory microcosms with a pool of 12 bacterivorous ciliated protist species. To eliminate the possibility of species diversity effects confounding with phylogenetic diversity effects, we assembled communities that had the same number of species but varied in the level of phylogenetic diversity. Weekly disturbance, in the form of short-term temperature shock, was imposed on each microcosm and species abundances were monitored over time. We examined the relationship between temporal stability of community biomass and phylogenetic diversity and evaluated the role of several stabilizing mechanisms for explaining the influence of phylogenetic diversity on temporal stability. Important FindingsOur results showed that increasing phylogenetic diversity promoted temporal stability of community biomass. Both total community biomass and summed variances showed a U-shaped relationship with phylogenetic diversity, driven by the presence of large, competitively superior species that attained large biomass and high temporal variation in their biomass in both low and high phylogenetic diversity communities. Communities without these species showed patterns consistent with the reduced strength of competition and increasingly asynchronous species responses to environmental changes under higher phylogenetic diversity, two mechanisms that can drive positive diversity-stability relationships. These results support the utility of species phylogenetic knowledge for predicting ecosystem functions and their stability.},

abstract = {The study of the interrelationship between productivity and biodiversity is a major research field in ecology. Theory predicts that if essential resources are heterogeneously distributed across a metacommunity, single species may dominate productivity in individual metacommunity patches, but a mixture of species will maximize productivity across the whole metacommunity. It also predicts that a balanced supply of resources within local patches should favor species coexistence, whereas resource imbalance would favor the dominance of one species. We performed an experiment with five freshwater algal species to study the effects of total supply of resources, their ratios, and species richness on biovolume production and evenness at the scale of both local patches and metacommunities. Generally, algal biovolume increased, whereas algal resource use efficiency (RUE) and evenness decreased with increasing total supply of resources in mixed communities containing all five species. In contrast to predictions for biovolume production, the species mixtures did not outperform all monocultures at the scale of metacommunities. In other words, we observed no general transgressive overyielding. However, RUE was always higher in mixtures than predicted from monocultures, and analyses indicate that resource partitioning or facilitation in mixtures resulted in higher-than-expected productivity at high resource supply. Contrasting our predictions for the local scale, balanced supply of resources did not generally favor higher local evenness, however lowest evenness was confined to patches with the most imbalanced supply. Thus, our study provides mixed support for recent theoretical advancements to understand biodiversity-productivity relationships.},

abstract = {Although there has been much recent interest in the effect of litter mixing on decomposition processes, much remains unknown about how litter mixing and diversity affects the abundance and diversity of decomposer organisms. We conducted a litter mixing experiment using litterbags in a New Zealand rainforest, in which treatments consisted of litter monocultures of each of 8 forest canopy and understory plant species, as well as mixtures of 2, 4 and 8 species. We found litter mixing to have little effect on net decomposition rates after either 279 or 658 days, and for each species decomposition rates in mixture treatments were the same as in monoculture. Litter species identity had important effects on litter microfauna, mesofauna and macrofauna, with different litter types promoting different subsets of the fauna. Litter mixing had few effects on densities of mesofauna and macrofauna, but did have some important effects on components of the microfauna, notably microbe-feeding and predatory nematodes. At day 279, litter mixing also consistently reduced the ratio of bacterial-feeding to microbe-feeding (bacterial-feeding+fungal-feeding) nematodes, pointing to mixing causing a significant switch from the bacterial-based to the fungal-based energy channel. Litter mixing sometimes influenced the community composition and diversity of nematodes and macrofauna, but effects of litter mixing on diversity were not necessarily positive, and were much weaker than effects of litter species identity on diversity. We conclude that litter mixing effects on the abundance and diversity of decomposer biota, when they occur, are likely to be of secondary and generally minor significance when compared to the effects of litter species identity and composition. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to optimize storage conditions of a microbial community used for degradation of petroleum-derived environmental contaminants. Microorganisms were either freeze-dried or directly frozen (-20°C) in the presence of four stabilizers: trehalose, sucrose, glycerol and DMSO. It was found that preincubation with trehalose and sucrose had a positive impact on cell viability for both tested storage techniques. Disaccharide-stabilized consortia were more biodiverse than control samples (untreated with any protectants) and they retained high xenobiotic biodegradation capabilities. The effect of glycerol and DMSO was unexpectedly poor, contradicting other findings on the protective action of these compounds on monocultures. Higher cell survival was achieved only upon short-term (7 days) freezing, whereas DMSO proved to be lethal in the case of freeze-dried communities. Taking into account practical and economic reasons, the use of sucrose rather than the more expensive trehalose appears as the most efficient method for microbial consortia biostabilization during long-term storage. The experimental work provides some important data concerning the problem of elaboration of improved methods for preserving robust microbial communities to be used in environmental biotechnology practice.},

abstract = {Wetlands provide many ecosystem services to society, most notably the provision of habitat for important plants and animals, the improvement of water quality, and the sequestration of carbon. Nitrogen and phosphorus budgets, vegetation structure and function, and carbon fluxes and accumulation are described for a pair of 1-ha created riverine wetlands in central Ohio USA over 20 years (1994-2013) of primary succession. The primary inflow to these experimental wetlands was from water pumped from the adjacent fourth-order Olentangy River. The pumping rate maintained for most of the years (an exception was a two-year comparison of pulsing and non-pulsing hydrology in the two wetlands in 2004-2005) was according to a pre-determined formula based on river stage. The pumped inflow to the wetlands averaged 38.7±1.5myr-1with precipitation averaging 1.1myr-1for the same years. Surface outflow averaged 27.1±1.4myr-1and subsurface seepage was estimated to be 13.2±0.2myr-1over that period. Both outflows returned water to the Olentangy River via surface and subsurface pathways respectively.Wetland plant richness increased from 13 species initially planted in one of the wetlands to 116 species overall after 17 years, with most of that richness (99 species) occurring in the first 5 years. The planted wetland had higher community diversity every year except one over 20 years while the naturally colonizing wetland was more productive especially in the first 7 years and overall still had 2000. kg more organic matter input by ANPP after 17 years than did the planted wetland.Nutrient mass inflows to the wetlands averaged 5.61±0.30 g-Pm-2yr-1(n=30 wetland years) for total phosphorus, 2.17±0.27g-Pm-2yr-1(n=30 wetland years) for soluble reactive phosphorus, 122±3g-Nm-2yr-1(n=14 wetland years) for total nitrogen, and 100±5g-Nm-2yr-1(n=32 wetland years) for nitrate-nitrogen. Retention rates were 2.40±0.23g-Pm-2yr-1for total phosphorus, 0.87±0.10g-Pm-2yr-1for soluble reactive phosphorus, 38.8±2.2g-Nm-2yr-1for total nitrogen, and 15.6±2.7g-Nm-2yr-1for nitrate-nitrogen. Total phosphorus retention was higher in the planted wetland compared to the natural colonizing wetland (44.3±4.4{\%} vs. 38.8±5.3{\%} respectively; p=0.059) while total nitrogen retention was significantly higher in the naturally colonizing wetland compared to the planted wetland (32.1±2.0{\%} vs. 28.4±2.6{\%} respectively; p=0.000085). Investigation of trends of water quality improvement showed that, overall, nutrient retention decreased from the beginning of the study through the 17th year in 2010. More recent trends showed tendencies for water quality improvement in 9 out of 11 of the nutrient parameters and time periods investigated between 2003 and 2010.The wetlands were effective carbon sinks, with rates of carbon sequestration (219-267g-Cm-2yr-1, higher than those measured in a reference natural flow-through wetland. Both carbon sequestration and methane emissions have been consistently higher in the naturally colonizing wetland, theorized as due to the greater productivity of this wetland over several years in the middle of this study.},

abstract = {Sustainable forest management of commercial monoculture plantations may be difficult to achieve in plantations of Monterrey pine because these commercial monocultures are managed under a clear cutting system, where the understory vegetation is initially damaged by harvesting, and subsequently, by herbicide application. Despite its marked structural changes following harvesting, the ecological role of understory in mitigating the negative impact of clear cutting on biodiversity is scarcely known. We test for the positive effect of the understory vegetation present in clearcut pine stands on the abundance and movement ability of the Chestnut-throated Huet-Huet (Pteroptochos castaneus), an insectivorous bird sensitive to adult pine plantations with scarce understory cover. Abundance was assessed through passive and broadcasting surveys during reproductive and pos-reproductive season at native forests, mature pine stands and cleacut areas. Movement was experimentally assessed as the willingness of individual Huet-Huets to enter into clearcuts from adjacent mature pint stands of native forest. The understory vegetation was the main predictor of P. castaneus abundance in native forest and mature pine plantations, but not into clearcut stands. Although Huet-Huets tended to be reluctant to enter into clearcuttings, their displacement into clearcuttings was positively influenced by the understory present in both the clearcut stands and the habitats where they had been experimentally attracted by playbacks (i.e., native forest or mature pine). We conclude that the conservation of P. castaneus in forest plantations involves modifying the traditional clearcutting system into a forest management that minimizes the use of herbicides while promoting the retention of understory vegetation and woody debris.},

abstract = {1. Results from four field studies show that communities of trap-nesting bees and wasps and their natural enemies are promising bioindicators for ecological change or habitat quality. These small and easy-to-handle communities can be analysed with respect to (i) species richness and related parameters, and (ii) ecological functions or interactions. The communities comprise Hymenoptera (Apidae, Sphecidae, Eumenidae, Pompilidae) and natural enemies belonging to many insect taxa. Traps consisted of 150-200, 15-20-cm long, reed internodes, put into tins or plastic tubes of 13-15 cm diameter; wooden posts with 2-10 of such reed-filled tins were exposed in the target habitat. 2. Species richness and abundance of bees (but not wasps) were closely related to plant species richness of the habitat, a measure of the bees' food resource. However, availability of nest sites of above-ground nesting species was equally important: meadows with old trees supported greater populations than meadows without trees. A threefold increase in exposed traps resulted in a twofold increase in species. 3. The sensitivity of this bioindicator system profits from the fact that evaluations rely not only on presence/absence data, descriptive population attributes or diversity indices, but also on interactions or ecological functions. Monitoring ecological responses or multitrophic interactions, and their relationship to species diversity, is rarely done but much needed. Ecological functions include (i) the percentage mortality of trap-nesting bees and wasps due to parasitoids and predators, which was correlated with the species richness of these natural enemies; (ii) seed set of allogamous plants due to successful pollination by trap-nesting bees; and (iii) biological control by the predacious wasps. 4. With increasing isolation of fragmented habitats (when traps were exposed in a cleared agricultural landscape), both species richness of natural enemies and percentage mortality (parasitism and predation) declined signicantly. In a comparison of habitat types (grasslands and field margins), species richness of the trap-nest community correlated with plant diversity, but percentage mortality, due to parasitism and predation, with field age only. The threshold distance to the nearest habitat was 106-530 m for a 10-50{\%} decrease in mean mortality, and the mortality increased greatly in habitats that were older than 5 years. Accordingly, these studies emphasize the significance of a continuum of old habitat patches for the augmentation of natural enemies. 5. Exposure of standardized traps is an experimental approach with a small, interacting and reproducing community that can be easily characterized by simple parameters. Taxonomy and biology are well known, and quick evaluations can be done using the close correlation between the number of occupied traps and species richness. Species richness of trap-nesting bees and wasps was closely correlated with that sampled by sweep nets. Further criteria of indicator taxa that apply to this system are discussed in the text.},

The aim of the study was to provide guidance on the optimal design for reliable treatment performance. A variety of factors were tested, using 125 large columns: plant species, filter media, filter depth, filter area and pollutant inflow concentration. The results demonstrate that vegetation selection is critical to performance for nitrogen removal (e.g. Carex appressa and Melaleuca ericifolia performed significantly better than other tested species). Whilst phosphorus removal was consistently very high (typically around 85{\%}), biofilter soil media with added organic matter reduced the phosphorus treatment effectiveness. Biofilters built according to observed 'optimal specifications' can reliably remove both nutrients (up to 70{\%} for nitrogen and 85{\%} for phosphorus) and suspended solids (consistently over 95{\%}). The optimally designed biofilter is at least 2{\%} of its catchment area and possesses a sandy loam filter media, planted with C. appressa or M. ericifolia. Further trials will be required to test a wider range of vegetation, and to examine performance over the longer term. Future work will also examine biofilter effectiveness for treatment of heavy metals and pathogens. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {? 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.Although the protective role of leaf litter cover against soil erosion is known for a long time, little research has been conducted on the processes involved. Moreover, the impact of soil meso- and macrofauna within the litter layer on erosion control is not clear. To investigate how leaf litter cover and diversity as well as meso- and macrofauna influence sediment discharge in subtropical forest ecosystems, a field experiment has been carried out in Southeast China. A full-factorial random design with 96 micro-scale runoff plots and 7 domestic leaf species was established and erosion was triggered by a rainfall simulator. Our results demonstrate that leaf litter cover protects soil from erosion (-82{\%} sediment discharge on leaf covered plots) by rainfall and this protection is removed as litter decomposes. The protective effect is influenced by the presence or absence of soil meso- and macrofauna. Fauna presence increases soil erosion rates significantly by 58 {\%}, while leaf species diversity shows a non-significant negative trend. We assume that the faunal effect arises from arthropods slackening and processing the soil surface as well as fragmenting and decomposing the protecting leaf litter covers. Even though the diversity level did not show a significant influence, single leaf species in monocultures show rather different impacts on sediment discharge and thus, erosion control. In our experiment, runoff plots with leaf litter from Machilus thunbergii showed the highest sediment discharge (68.0gm-2) whereas plots with Cyclobalanopsis glauca showed the smallest rates (7.9gm-2).},

abstract = {This study focused on the effects of plant compositions on removal rates of pollutants in microcosms through investigating rhizosphere microbial populations, photosynthetic efficiency and growth characteristics. Mixed-culture groups improved the removal efficiency of TN and TP significantly but exhibited lower COD removal rates. Total plant biomasses were improved as the species richness increased, but the N/P content in the plants was mainly affected by the type of species. The mixed-culture groups showed lower photosynthesis rates and oxygen supply generated from roots under high irradiation. Microbial communities of the cultured groups in the rhizosphere exhibited significant differences. According to principal component analysis (PCA), the fungi were the typical microbes of SPA, SPAB, and SPABC, resulted in improvement in nutrient accumulation. These results demonstrated that a mixed culture strategy can represent the overyielding of biomass, promote the photo-protection mechanism, and will further increase the removal rates of pollutants in a constructed wetland.},

abstract = {Plant biodiversity theory suggests that increased plant species diversity contributes to the stability of ecosystems. In managed grasslands, such as pastures, greater stability of herbage production would be beneficial. In this retrospective study, I used data from three reports from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1960s to determine whether increasing mixture complexity contributed to yield stability with time. Yield data from a total of 175 mixtures of grasses and legumes (two to seven species per mixture) in experiments of 3-6 year duration in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Utah, USA, were used in the analysis. Regression was used to examine relationships among herbage yield, stability of yield [measured as the interannual coefficient of variation (CV)], and diversity measures [Shannon diversity index (H), species richness (S), and evenness (J)]. In several instances there was no relationship between herbage yield or yield stability and the complexity (number of species) of the mixture. In one experiment, the proportion of legume in the sward seemed to be the controlling factor regarding herbage yield and yield stability. Monocultures and binary mixtures frequently had the highest interannual CV (e.g., less yield stability) than more complex mixtures. Within forage mixtures, however, there was no consistent relationship between herbage yield or yield stability and measures of species diversity. Species identity and composition of forage mixtures may be more important determinants of herbage yield than simply the number of species.},

abstract = {With the global loss of natural wetlands, waterbirds have become increasingly dependent on alternative and artificial habitats, but the use of such wetlands by waterbirds is typically opportunistic and little consideration has been given to the potential implications for water treatment or waterbird conservation objectives. Wastewater treatment wetlands are currently of critical importance for certain waterbird species in some parts of the world, and we illustrate this with an example fromsouth-eastern Australia. Furthermore, we argue that their significance is likely to increase as they offer the most realistic means of treating wastewater in developing countries, where the demand for improved sanitation to lift people out of poverty is intense. There is little scientific evidence to guide the construction of wastewater treatment wetlands with waterbird conservation in mind. The use of wastewater by waterbirds poses health risks for both birds and humans and these risks must be better understood. Wastewater treatment wetlands are not a substitute for natural wetlands and reliance upon them should not compromise wetland conservation efforts. Nonetheless, they are a potentially valuable resource for waterbirds, and research should be directed towards deepening our understanding of their global distribution; food-web dynamics; methods of deterring or excluding birds when bird or human health may be compromised; the effects of wastewater contaminants and pathogens on birds; and the role of waterbirds in human disease transmission},

abstract = {Green roofs are becoming a standard component in environmentally aware modern urban planning. In an attempt to maximize the benefits from these roofs, the choice and management of the flora on the roofs remain understudied, especially in non-temperate climates. While the perennial succulent, Sedum, is commonly planted on green roofs, the use and integration of additional plant forms can potentially create more biodiverse roofs. Here, we conducted an experiment to evaluate the interactions between the local Sedum sediforme and local annuals under a Mediterranean climate. We followed the development of S. sediforme and annuals and monitored the invasibility of the green roof over three years. We additionally monitored the substrate temperature, moisture, conductivity, pH, nitrate and percent organic matter. In an attempt to increase intraspecific competition, which is predicted to reduce interspecific competition, S. sediforme were initially arranged in two different dispersion patterns − uniform and clumped. Three levels of S. sediforme (absent, uniform and clumped) were crossed with the presence or absence of twenty species of annuals, introduced as seeds. Sedum sediforme dispersion did not differentially affect annuals, but both dispersion patterns of S. sediforme reduced biomass and diversity of annuals during the third year. Annual presence reduced clumped dispersion of S. sediforme cover and inflorescences throughout all three years, but increased total chlorophyll levels in S. sediforme leaf tissue during the third year. Sedum sediforme also reduced abundance and biomass of colonizing plants. Sedum sediforme and annuals each showed valuable enhancements to some of the most important green roof functions. Annuals increased nitrate fixation in the substrate which may have explained the increased levels of chlorophyll and carotenoids in S. sediforme in these treatments. Finally, S. sediforme interacted with annuals to reduce substrate temperature and presence of annuals reduced substrate moisture thereby improving storm-water abatement capacity. We conclude that the combination of annuals and S. sediforme in Mediterranean green roofs will improve green roof function as an important component in future sustainable urban planning.},
annote = {BACKGROUND
- Mediterrean ecosystem
- Sedum reduces water loss from soil, prevents evaporation from substrate surface
- S. sediforme has late phenology stage; monocultures may provide low pollination services
- S. sediforme and annuals could be a good mix, but unclear about strengh of competition vs facilitation mechanisms 
- testing dfferent spatial patterns between annuals and sedums to detect potential competition or facilitation mechanisms

FINDINGS:
- strong competition between Sedum and annual
(1) reduced inflorescenes for Sedum
(2) reduced cover for Sedum
- some evidence of facilitation: N-fixing plants lead to higher levels of nitrate, which supported sedum species
- Presence of sedum enhances cooling effects; other species can be more efficient in rain mitigation},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bees are the primary pollinators of angiosperms throughout the world. There are more than 16,000 described species, with broad variation in life history traits such as nesting habitat, diet, and social behavior. Despite their importance as pollinators, the evolution of bee biodiversity is understudied: relationships among the seven families of bees remain controversial, and no empirical global-level reconstruction of historical biogeography has been attempted. Morphological studies have generally suggested that the phylogeny of bees is rooted near the family Colletidae, whereas many molecular studies have suggested a root node near (or within) Melittidae. Previous molecular studies have focused on a relatively small sample of taxa ({\~{}}150 species) and genes (seven at most). Public databases contain an enormous amount of DNA sequence data that has not been comprehensively analysed in the context of bee evolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We downloaded, aligned, concatenated, and analysed all available protein-coding nuclear gene DNA sequence data in GenBank as of October, 2011. Our matrix consists of 20 genes, with over 17,000 aligned nucleotide sites, for over 1,300 bee and apoid wasp species, representing over two-thirds of bee genera. Whereas the matrix is large in terms of number of genes and taxa, there is a significant amount of missing data: only {\~{}}15{\%} of the matrix is populated with data. The placement of the root as well as relationships between Andrenidae and other bee families remain ambiguous, as several alternative maximum-likelihood estimates fall within the statistically credible set. However, we recover strong bootstrap support for relationships among many families and for their monophyly. Ancestral geographic range reconstruction suggests a likely origin of bees in the southern hemisphere, with Melittidae ancestrally located within Africa, and Halictidae, Colletidae, and Apidae within the New World.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study affirms the monophyly of each bee family, sister-taxa relationships between Apidae and Megachilidae (the 'long-tongued bees'), between Colletidae and Stenotritidae, and between Colletidae + Stenotritidae and Halictidae. Our analyses reject a Colletidae-basal hypothesis for family-level relationships and instead support Melittidae as sister to the remaining bees. Southern hemisphere vicariance likely played an important role in early diversification within many bee families.},

abstract = {Green roofs are increasingly being used among the suite of tools designed to reduce the volume of surface water runoff generated by cities. Plants provide the primary mechanism for restoring the rainfall retention capacity of green roofs, but selecting plants with high water use is likely to increase drought stress. Using empirically-derived plant physiological parameters, we used a water balance model to assess the trade-off between rainfall retention and plant drought stress under a 30-year climate scenario. We compared high and low water users with either drought avoidance or drought tolerance strategies. Green roofs with low water-using, drought-avoiding species achieved high rainfall retention (66–81{\%}) without experiencing significant drought stress. Roofs planted with other strategies showed high retention (72–90{\%}), but they also experienced {\textgreater} 50 days of drought stress per year. However, not all species with the same strategy behaved similarly, therefore selecting plants based on water use and drought strategy alone does not guarantee survival in shallow substrates where drought stress can develop quickly. Despite this, it is more likely that green roofs will achieve high rainfall retention with minimal supplementary irrigation if planted with low water users with drought avoidance strategies.},

Combining a complete avian phylogeny with surveys along urbanisation gradients from five continents, we show that highly urbanised environments supported on average 450 million fewer years of evolutionary history than the surrounding natural environments. This loss was primarily caused by species loss and could have been higher had not been partially compensated by the addition of urban exploiters and some exotic species. Highly urbanised environments also supported fewer evolutionary distinctive species, implying a disproportionate loss of evolutionary history. Compared with highly urbanised environments, changes in phylogenetic richness and evolutionary distinctiveness were less substantial in moderately urbanised environments. Protecting pristine environments is therefore essential for maintaining phylogenetic diversity, but moderate levels of urbanisation still preserve much of the original diversity.},

abstract = {1. Recent studies have shown that the positive relationship between plant diversity and plant biomass ('overyielding') can be explained by soil pathogens depressing productivity more in low than in high diverse plant communities. However, tests of such soil effects in field studies were constrained by experimental limitations to manipulate soil community composition independent of plant community composition. Here, we report of an experiment where feedback effects to plants were tested for both plant and soil monocultures and mixtures. 2. Our results demonstrate that overyielding is the result of plant species in mixture being more growth-limited by 'own' soil biota than by soil biota of other plant species. This effect disappeared when the soils had been sterilized by gamma-irradiation. Mixing plants themselves did not result in overyielding except when grown in the soil of one of the species (Leucanthemum vulgare), where growth of one species disproportionally increased in mixture compared to monoculture. 3. Soil nutrient availability could not explain differences in growth between the non-sterilized soils. Therefore, our results suggest that plant species-specific soil biota rather than the plants have contributed to the plant community overyielding. 4. Species biomass ranking in mixtures highly differed between non-sterilized soils of different histories of soil conditioning, whilst the ranking was more consistent in sterilized soil. Sterilized soils of different origin differed significantly in nutrient availability. These results suggest that shifts in competitive hierarchies depend on plant species-specific interactions influenced by soil biota and cannot be induced by mineral nitrogen. 5. Synthesis. Our results show that overyielding in four plant species mixtures can be due to species-specific interactions between plants and their specific soil biota. Neither mixing the plant species alone nor the differential responses of species to mineral nitrogen influenced community productivity, but mixing soil biota did.},

abstract = {1. Agriculture now constitutes 40–50{\%} of terrestrial land use globally. By enhancing habitat suitability and connectivity, restoration within agricultural landscapes could have a major influence on biodiversity conservation. However, habitat management within intensive agri- cultural landscapes may primarily boost abundances of common, highly mobile generalists, rather than vulnerable or endangered species. We studied pollinator community response to small-scale habitat restoration in the intensively farmed Central Valley of California to deter- mine whether restoration could also promote more specialized, less common and/or less mobile species. 2. Composition of pollinator communities was assessed in five experimental and 10 control (unrestored) sites before and after restoration of native plant hedgerows over an 8-year per- iod, using a before-after control-impact design. 3. We characterized bee and fly species based on functional response traits [floral specializa- tion, habitat specialization, abundance, body size and sociality (bees only)] known to influ- ence the response to habitat change. 4. We modelled how species occurrences changed with habitat restoration over time as mod- ulated by their response traits. 5. We found that hedgerows not only significantly enhanced occurrences of native bee and syrphid fly species, but that as hedgerows matured, they had a greater positive effect on spe- cies that were more specialized in floral and nesting resources and smaller (less mobile). 6. Synthesis and applications. Unlike previous studies that suggest habitat restoration in agri- cultural landscapes only benefits mobile, generalist species, our results suggest that small-scale habitat restoration can promote species whose traits likely render them particularly vulnerable to habitat degradation. Thus, even within highly intensive agricultural landscapes, small-scale habitat restoration can be a conservation management tool. However, tailoring habitat enhancements to promote certain species or guilds may be critical for their success as a con- servation intervention in agricultural landscapes.},

abstract = {Green roofs provide many ecosystem services such as regulation of building temperatures, reducing urban heat-island effects and draining rainwater. In addition, they are expected to reduce the high levels of CO2concentrations in big cities. Previous CO2fixation studies on green roofs were done by taking long-time-period samples using expensive equipment and with limited replication. To plan green roofs for optimal CO2reduction, a simple method to quantify CO2fixation rate in relation to plant species-composition is required. The method we tested is direct measurement of CO2concentrations with a portable air-quality meter, which allows a large number of samples. Here we focus on differences in the photosynthetic effect between plots containing the local Mediterranean succulent, Sedum sediforme and plots containing various annuals. In a factorial design (presence or absence of Sedum crossed with presence or absence of annuals), we tested the effect of sedum and annual treatments on CO2concentrations. To compare our results with a commonly used method, and to evaluate the role of the different species, we examined the photosynthetic activity at the single plant level under these treatments by using a portable gas-exchange measuring system. We found that our method can detect the effect of different green roof plots and can be used as a simple and reliable tool for green-roof planers. We found that annuals reduced CO2concentrations, but only in the absence of Sedum. Sedum alone had no effect on CO2concentrations. This emphasizes the importance of integrating plots with annual plants in Sedum-based green roofs.},

abstract = {Despite being conspicuous and influential features of the biosphere, urban ecosystems have been neglected in ecological research. Arthropods are abundant in urban settings, but little is known about how these animals respond to urbanization. We systematically monitored the structure of ground arthropod communities for 12 months at 16 sites representing the four most abundant forms of urban land use (residential, industrial, agricultural, and desert remnant) in a rapidly growing metropolitan area (Phoenix, AZ). Although taxonomic richness was comparable among land-use types, community composition differed, with certain taxa being uniquely associated with each form of land use. Three taxa (springtails, ants, and mites) were extremely widespread and abundant, accounting for over 92{\%} of captures; when these three taxa were excluded from analysis, however, differences were revealed in arthropod community composition with urban land use. Trophic dynamics also varied with land use: predators, herbivores, and detritivores were most abundant in agricultural sites, while onmivores were equally abundant in all forms of land use. These community-level differences resulted from taxon-specific responses to habitat structure, which varied with land use. Because arthropod community structure is affected by habitat structure and land use, and because arthropods play key roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, pollination, and soil aeration, the spatial heterogeneity of urban ecosystems therefore may affect ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

While a small number of green roofs have been constructed in Australia, most are roof gardens or intensive green roofs. Despite their potential as a climate change adaptation and mitigation tool and their widespread use in the northern hemisphere, there are very few examples of extensive green roofs in Australia. One of the major barriers to increasing the prevalence of extensive green roofs in Australia is the lack of scientific data available to evaluate their applicability to local conditions. Relying on European and North American experience and technology is problematic due to significant differences in climate, available substrates and plants. This paper examines green roofs in Australia, discusses the challenges to increasing their use and the major information gaps that need to be researched to progress the industry in Australia. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {The ecological niche is a multi-dimensional concept including aspects of resource use, environmental tolerance, and interspecific interactions, and the degree to which niches overlap is central to many ecological questions. Plant phenotypic traits are increasingly used as surrogates of species niches, but we lack an understanding of how key sampling decisions affect our ability to capture phenotypic differences among species. Using trait data of ecologically distinct monkeyflower (Mimulus) congeners, we employed linear discriminant analysis to determine how (1) dimensionality (the number and type of traits) and (2) variation within species influence how well measured traits reflect phenotypic differences among species. We conducted analyses using vegetative and floral traits in different combinations of up to 13 traits and compared the performance of commonly used functional traits such as specific leaf area against other morphological traits. We tested the importance of intraspecific variation by assessing how population choice changed our ability to discriminate species. Neither using key functional traits nor sampling across plant functions and organs maximized species discrimination. When using few traits, vegetative traits performed better than combinations of vegetative and floral traits or floral traits alone. Overall, including more traits increased our ability to detect phenotypic differences among species. Population choice and the number of traits used had comparable impacts on discriminating species. We addressed methodological challenges that have undermined cross-study comparability of trait-based approaches. Our results emphasize the importance of sampling among-population trait variation and suggest that a high-dimensional approach may best capture phenotypic variation among species with distinct niches.},

The bio-agronomic performance, the biodiversity dynamics during the two-years experiment, and the pollinating fauna, were analysed.Each plant group was able to efficiently colonize the surface of the roof though in different periods and with various modalities. Thermal insulation of green roof was connected to different development dynamics of leaf canopies. In particular, this cooling effect took place during the peak of the vegetation's growth pattern. As expected, each plant group had differing flowering periods, during which were observed coincided highest rate of pollinator' visits (domestic and solitary bees, bumblebees, lepidoptera, diptera both syrphidae and bombyliidae). The agronomic management, consisting in senescent vegetation mowing, was of crucial importance to ensure the plant equilibrium of spring and summer flowering species. The lack of a prevailing species was highlighted by several biodiversity indexes. On the contrary, early and late flowering species (geophytes) did not require any vegetation management. In conclusion, even if wildflowers exhibit critical aspects in terms of covering dynamics, due to the periodic senescence of vegetation, they represent a valid instrument to improve the biodiversity and the landscape of the Mediterranean urban ecosystem. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract. Three common Appalachian plant species (Juncus effusus L., Scirpus validus L., and Typha latifolia L.) were planted into small-scale constructed wetlands receiving primary treated wastewater. The experimental design included two wetland gravel depths (45 and 60 cm) and five planting treatments (each species in monoculture, an equal mixture of the three species, and controls without vegetation), with two replicates per depth planting combination. Inflow rates (19 L day−1) and frequency (3 times day−1) were designed to simulate full-scale constructed wetlands as currently used for domestic wastewater treatment in West Virginia. Influent wastewater and the effluent from each wetland were sampled monthly for ten physical, chemical and biological parameters, and plant demographic measurements were made. After passing through these trough wetlands, the average of all treatments showed a 70{\%} reduction in total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 50 to 60{\%} reduction in nitrogen (TKN), ammonia and phosphate, and a reduction of fecal coliforms by three orders of magnitude. Depth of gravel (45 or 60 cm) had little effect on wetland treatment ability, but did influence Typha and Scirpus growth patterns. Gravel alone provided significant wastewater treatment, but vegetation further improved many treatment efficiencies. Typha significantly out-performed Juncus and Scirpus both in growth and in effluent quality improvement. There was also some evidence that the species mixture out-performed species monocultures. Typha was the superior competitor in mixtures, but a decline in Typha growth with distance from the influent pipe suggested that nutrients became limiting or toxicities may have developed.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity (PD) describes the total amount of phylogenetic distance among species in a community. Although there has been substantial research on the factors that determine community PD, exploration of the consequences of PD for ecosystem functioning is just beginning. We argue that PD may be useful in predicting ecosystem functions in a range of communities, from single-trophic to complex networks. Many traits show a phylogenetic signal, suggesting that PD can estimate the functional trait space of a community, and thus ecosystem functioning. Phylogeny also determines interactions among species, and so could help predict how extinctions cascade through ecological networks and thus impact ecosystem functions. Although the initial evidence available suggests patterns consistent with these predictions, we caution that the utility of PD depends critically on the strength of phylogenetic signals to both traits and interactions. We advocate for a synthetic approach that incorporates a deeper understanding of how traits and interactions are shaped by evolution, and outline key areas for future research. If these complexities can be incorporated into future studies, relationships between PD and ecosystem function bear promise in conceptually unifying evolutionary biology with ecosystem ecology.},

However, these experiments often conclude that there is a higher probability of including complementary species combinations in assemblages with more species and lack a priori prediction about which species combinations maximize function. Here, I report the results of an experiment manipulating the evolutionary relatedness of constituent plant species across a richness gradient. I show that assemblages with distantly related species contributed most to the higher biomass production in multispecies assemblages, through species complementarity. Species produced more biomass than predicted from their monocultures when they were in plots with distantly related species and produced the amount of biomass predicted from monoculture when sown with close relatives. This finding suggests that in the absence of any other information, combining distantly related species in restored or managed landscapes may serve to maximize biomass production and carbon sequestration, thus merging calls to conserve evolutionary history and maximize ecosystem function.},

abstract = {We tested predictions of the relative changes in plant leaf traits in response to land uses in Australian eucalypt grassy ecosystems. Predictions were determined from responses observed in European landscapes in relation to disturbances associated with agricultural land uses. We measured specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) across five land uses: reference sites (closest to pre-European state), native pastures (unfertilized), fertilized pastures, sown pastures (cultivated and fertilized) and enriched grassland (previously fertilized, no longer grazed). Leaves were expected to have higher SLA and lower LMDC at sites with increasing fertility and/or disturbance. The predictions were confirmed, with SLA increasing progressively in land uses associated with (1) grazing; (2) grazing and fertilization; (3) grazing, fertilization and cultivation. Values for LDMC were closely (but inversely) correlated with those of SLA. For both traits, there were relationships with available soil phosphorus but not with soil total nitrogen. The positive correlation of SLA with phosphorus was not evident above 30 mg kg-1, the recommended level of phosphorus for improved pastures. Results confirm patterns of leaf-trait response to disturbance that reflect fundamental constraints to plant survival in habitats with different levels of resources and disturbances. A conservative strategy for low productivity undisturbed habitats is associated with low SLA and high dry matter content in contrast to fertile disturbed habitats which select for high SLA and low dry matter content. The changes in leaf traits across land uses resulted from species substitution rather than variation within species across sites, and most notably the replacement of native by annual exotic species as land use intensifies. Recommended fertilization rates for pasture production convert the ground layer to plants with soft, digestible leaves, that are responsive to fertilizer and desirable for livestock production. However, fertilization also drastically reduces the diversity of native plants and annual plants tend to dominate. The trade-off associated with high production includes increased vulnerability to soil erosion, due to reduced plant cover and low persistence of cover. If alternative ecosystem values such as erosion control, water quality, salinity control and biodiversity persistence are required, incentives may be needed to offset the loss of production that can be gained from fertilizer application.

The study aimed to determine the feasibility of establishing annual plant species from a seed mixture and to determine the appropriate sowing rate as well as the necessity of watering during the first growing season from June to November 2006. A 22-species seed mixture was sown on an experimental green roof with a substrate depth of 7cm using two sowing rates (2g/m2and 4g/m2) and two watering regimes (with and without watering). The watering regime consisted of application of water four times over the course of the experiment. Each combination of sowing and watering regime yielded a successful aesthetic annual meadow green roof. Results showed that a low sowing rate resulted in better conditions for individual plant growth when enough water was available. On the other hand, a high sowing rate was necessary to ensure a sufficient number of plants when water resources were not abundant. The watering regime improved growth in most species; however, it was determined that an annual seed mixture could perform well without watering at the study site. The annual meadow possessed an abundance of flowering plants for an extended period of time; plants started flowering one month after sowing and continued until the end of October. Successful species during the first growing season included Alyssum maritimum, Echium plantagineum 'Blue Bedder', Gypsophila muralis, Iberis amara, Iberis umbellata 'Fairy', Linaria elegans and Linaria maroccana. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recent declines of bee species have led to great interest in preserving and promoting bee populations for agricultural and wild plant pollination. Many correlational studies have examined the indirect effects of factors such as landscape context and land management practices and found great variation in bee response. We focus here on the evidence for effects of direct factors (i.e., food resources, nesting resources, and incidental risks) regulating bee populations and then interpret varied responses to indirect factors through their species-specific and habitat-specific effects on direct factors. We find strong evidence for food resource availability regulating bee populations, but little clear evidence that other direct factors are commonly limiting. We recommend manipulative experiments to illuminate the effects of these different factors. We contend that much of the variation in impact from indirect factors, such as grazing, can be explained by the relationships between indirect factors and floral resource availability based on environmental circumstances.},

The green roof environment with its exposure to intense sun and wind and limited moisture restricts the capacity for a large diversity of species. The result has been, in many cases, a standard, low-diversity mix of Sedum species often focused on ornament and minimizes the potential for wider environmental benefits. We reviewed the ecological literature on prairie and grassland communities with specific reference to habitat templates from stressed environmental conditions and examined analogs of prairie-based vegetation on twenty-one existing green roofs. We found that many, but not all prairie and grassland species will survive and thrive on green roofs, especially when irrigated as needed or given adequate growing medium depth. We raise several important questions about media, irrigation, temperature, biodiversity and their interactions needing more study.},

abstract = {The ability to predict the responses of ecological communities and individual species to human-induced environmental change remains a key issue for ecologists and conservation managers alike. Responses are often variable among species within groups making general predictions difficult. One option is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this "trait-guild" approach has been used for single disturbances, the importance of particular traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural intensification, pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests - above vs. below ground - significantly affected response to habitat loss, agricultural intensification, tillage regime (within agriculture) and fire. Species that nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In contrast below-ground-nesting species were more negatively affected by tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response of different nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn. Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body size did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in determining many aspects of individuals' interaction with their environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored, individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of related species to global change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study focused on the relationship between plant diversity (six species richness levels) and nutrient retention and enzyme activities associated with carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in a full-scale constructed wetland (CW) fed with post-treatment domestic wastewater. Effects of plant species richness on nutrient retention and enzyme activities were assessed using soil chemical and zymological methods, respectively. Retention of NH4-N and NO3-N in the wetland substrate increased with increasing species richness, while phosphorus retention significantly decreased under the richness level of 16 species per plot. Activities of enzymes such as dehydrogenase, $\beta$-glucosidase, invertase, phenol oxidase, L-arsparaginase, protease and nitrate reductase, while they were affected by plant species richness, were strongly depended on the presence or absence of plants in CW substrate, while activities of enzymes such as CM-cellulase, urease and acid phosphatase were strongly depended on plant species richness. We conclude that plant species richness influenced nutrient retention and enzyme activities in the substrate in our subtropical CW; increase plant species richness in CW will likely improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we evaluated patterns in species richness, phylogenetic structure and life-history traits of bee communities along altitudinal gradients in the Alps, Germany. We found a linear decline in species richness and abundance but increasing phylogenetic clustering in communities with increasing altitude. The proportion of social- and ground-nesting species, as well as mean body size and altitudinal range of bee communities, increased with increasing altitude, whereas the mean geographical distribution decreased. Our results suggest that community assembly at high altitudes is dominated by environ- mental ﬁltering effects, whereas the relative importance of competition increases at low altitudes. We conclude that inherent phylogenetic and ecological species attributes at high altitudes pose a threat for less competitive alpine specialists with ongoing climate change.},

Garden quadrats contained more than twice as many taxa as those from any other habitat type. Ca. 33 {\%} of garden plants were natives and 67 {\%} aliens, mainly from Europe and Asia. A higher proportion of garden aliens originated from Asia and New Zealand than in the UK alien flora as a whole; 18 of the 20 most frequent plants in garden quadrats were natives, mostly common weeds. Garden quadrats showed no evidence of 'nestedness', i.e. a tendency for scarce species to be confined to the highest diversity quadrats. Conversely, species in all semi-natural and derelict land data sets were significantly nested. Compared to a range of semi-natural habitats, species richness of garden quadrats was intermediate, and strikingly similar to the richness of derelict land quadrats. Although species accumulation curves for all other habitats showed signs of saturation at 120 quadrats, gardens did not. Correlations between S{\o} rensen similarity index and physical distance were insignificant for all habitat types, i.e. there was little evidence that physical distance played any part in structuring the composition of the quadrats in any of the data sets. However, garden quadrats were much less similar to each other than quadrats from semi-natural habitats or derelict land.},

This study investigated the impact different climates have on the retention performance of identical green roofs installed in London Ontario (humid continental), Calgary Alberta (semi-arid, continental), and Halifax Nova Scotia (humid, maritime). Drier climates were found to have greater percent cumulative stormwater retention with Calgary (67{\%}) having significantly better percent retention than both London (48{\%}) and Halifax (34{\%}). However, over the same study period the green roof in London retained the greatest depth of stormwater (598 mm), followed by the green roof in Halifax (471 mm) and then Calgary (411 mm). The impact of climate was largest for medium sized storms where the antecedent moisture condition (AMC) at the beginning of a rainfall event governs retention performance. Importantly AMC was a very good predictor of stormwater retention, with similar retention at all three sites for a given AMC, emphasizing that AMC is a relevant indicator of retention performance in any climate. For large rainfall events (i.e., {\textgreater}45 mm) green roof average retention ranged between 16{\%} and 29{\%} in all cities. Overall, drier climates have superior retention due to lower AMC in the media. However, moderate and wet climates still provide substantial total volume reduction benefits.},

Urbanization transforms floras through a series of filters that change: (i) habitat availability; (ii) the spatial arrangement of habitats; (iii) the pool of plant species; and (iv) evolutionary selection pressures on populations persisting in the urban environment. 3. Using a framework based on mechanisms of change leads to specific predictions of floristic change in urban environments. Explicitly linking drivers of floristic change to predicted outcomes in urban areas can facilitate sustainable management of urban vegetation as well as the conservation of biodiversity. 4. Synthesis . We outline how the use of our proposed framework, based on environmental filtering, can be used to predict responses of floras to urbanization. These floristic responses can be assessed using metrics of taxonomic composition, phylogenetic relatedness among species, plant trait distributions or plant community structure. We outline how this framework can be applied to studies that compare floras within cities or among cities to better understand the various floristic responses to urbanization.},

abstract = {Large-scale genomic data offers the perspective to decipher the genetic architecture of natural selection. To characterize natural selection, various analytical methods for detecting candidate genomic regions have been developed. We propose to perform genome-wide scans of natural selection using principal component analysis. We show that the common Fst index of genetic differentiation between populations can be viewed as a proportion of variance explained by the principal components. Looking at the correlations between genetic variants and each principal component provides a conceptual framework to detect genetic variants involved in local adaptation without any prior definition of populations. To validate the PCA-based approach, we consider the 1000 Genomes data (phase 1) after removal of recently admixed individuals resulting in 850 individuals coming from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The number of genetic variants is of the order of 36 millions obtained with a low-coverage sequencing depth (3X). The correlations between genetic variation and each principal component provide well-known targets for positive selection (EDAR, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, DARC), and also new candidate genes (APPBPP2, TP1A1, RTTN, KCNMA, MYO5C) and non-coding RNAs. In addition to identifying genes involved in biological adaptation, we identify two biological pathways involved in polygenic adaptation that are related to the innate immune system (beta defensins) and to lipid metabolism (fatty acid omega oxidation). PCA-based statistics retrieve well-known signals of human adaptation, which is encouraging for future whole-genome sequencing project, especially in non-model species for which defining populations can be difficult. Genome scan based on PCA is implemented in the open-source and freely available PCAdapt software.},

A set of 12 traits was selected for each species, characterizing rarity, biogeographical distribution, body size, trophic guild, dispersal power, reproductive potential and phenology. We used a three-table ordination method, RLQ analysis, to link directly bird, beetle and butterfly traits to the same set of landscape metrics calculated in 400 m-radius buffers around sample points. RLQ analyses showed significant associations between life-history traits and landscape configuration for all three taxonomical groups. Threatened species from all groups were characterized by a combination of life traits that makes them especially sensitive to the fragmentation of herbaceous and shrub-dominated habitats at the landscape scale. These key life traits were low productivity, intermediate body mass, restricted geographic range, late phenology and ground gleaning for threatened birds, intermediate body size, spring adult activity, northern distribution and summer breeding period for threatened carabids, and restricted range, overwintering as eggs or larvae, low mobility, monophagy and short flight periods for threatened butterflies. Focusing on species life traits can provide a functional perspective, which helps to determine adequate measures for the conservation of threatened species and communities of several taxonomical groups in mosaic landscapes.},

abstract = {The lack of space in urban areas can be a reason for their lack of green areas and sanitation provisions. Since roofs represent common unused space, they become an option to locate natural treatment systems such as constructed wetlands (CW). A conventional CW is too heavy to be placed on a roof, hence its design must be adjusted without altering its treatment properties. Thus, the concept of a constructed wetroof (CWR) was developed, a 9-cm-depth system composed of sand, organic soil, light expanded clay aggregates (LECA), polylactic acid beads (PLA) and roots. Due to the shallow depth and unsheltered location, the CWR is susceptible to changes in its physical and hydrological properties (such as a hot day causing severe evapotranspiration that dries out the filter media and the plants) that may lead to treatment failures. Therefore, this study investigates the capacity of a CWR to treat (low organic loaded) domestic wastewater (DWW) from an office building in The Netherlands. The results showed that the CWR is a highly aerobic system that treats DWW beyond the levels required by local discharge quality guidelines for organic matter, solids, NH4+-N, total nitrogen and total phosphorus ({\textgreater}79{\%} for all parameters tested). Further investigation is needed to test the CWR performance at higher organic loading rates. The roots, organic soil and sand provided the majority of the treatment; while the LECA and PLA were used mainly to provide volume without increasing significantly the weight. LECA also played a significant role in phosphorus removal. Although the hydrology of the CWR was highly weather dependent, however the treatment efficiency was not affected by it. Moreover, the rain had a minor effect on washing away the nutrients retained in the CWR media. The CWR provided a resilient and efficient DWW treatment that requires, as it is placed on a roof, 0 m2per population equivalent.},

Historically, Sedum species have been the most commonly used plants because, with proper species selection, they are tolerant of extreme temperatures, high winds, low fertility, and a limited water supply. A greenhouse study was conducted to determine how water availability influences growth and survival of a mixture of Sedum spp. on a green roof drainage system. Results indicate that substrate volumetric moisture content can be reduced to 0 m3 m3 within 1 day after watering depending on substrate depth and composition. Deeper substrates provided additional growth with sufficient water, but also required additional irrigation because of the higher evapotranspiration rates resulting from the greater biomass. Over the 88 day study, water was required at least once every 14 days to support growth in green roof substrates with a 2-cm media depth. However, substrates with a 6-cm media depth could do so with a watering only once every 28 days. Although vegetation was still viable after 88 days of drought, water should be applied at least once every 28 days for typical green roof substrates and more frequently for shal- lower substrates to sustain growth. The ability of Sedum to withstand extended drought conditions makes it ideal for shallow green roof systems.},

Here, I use leaves to illustrate the crucial role of ecological, biogeographic and phylogenetic comparisons in generating and testing hypotheses regarding the adaptive significance of morphological variation, the relative importance of selective pressures vs phylogenetic constraints, and the rise of adaptations within lineages. The complementary roles of comparative studies and optimality models are stressed throughout. The first section of this paper reviews 23 ecological patterns in leaf form, physiology and arrangement which have heen uncovered hy comparative studies. Three general sets of energetic trade-offs, involving the economics of gas exchange, support, and hiotic interactions, appear likely to influence the evolution of leaves and underlie these trends. The first of these trade-offs is illustrated with an analysis of the adaptive significance of leaf size, in both terrestrial and aquatic plants. The resulting predictions are compared with the actual trends observed, and the relative strengths and limitations of the approach are discussed},

A phylogenetic framework should partially solve this problem, as trait similarity is generally correlated with species relatedness, closely related species should have similar sensitivities to disturbance. Disturbance should thus result in community assemblages of closely related species. We tested this hypothesis with 18 disturbed and 16 reference whole-lake, long-term zooplankton data sets. Regardless of disturbance type, communities generally contained more closely related species when disturbed. This effect was independent of species richness, evenness, and abundance. Communities already under stress (i.e., those in acidic lakes) changed most when disturbed. Species sensitivities to specific disturbances were phylogenetically conserved, were independent of body size, and could be predicted by the sensitivities of close relatives within the same community. Phylogenetic relatedness can effectively act as a proxy for missing trait information when predicting community and species responses to disturbance},

However, recent criticisms cast doubt on our ability to accurately infer filtering because competition can give rise to patterns identical to those caused by environmental filtering. While experiments can distinguish mechanisms, observational patterns are especially problematic. The environment determines community composition not only directly via survival, but also by influencing competition. If species population growth rates covary with environmental gradients, then outcomes of competitive exclusion will also vary with the environment. Here, we argue that observational studies remain valuable, but inferences about the importance of the environment cannot rely on compositional data alone, and that species abundances, population growth, or traits must be correlated with the environment.},

abstract = {Predicting ecosystem responses to global change is a major challenge in ecology. A critical step in that challenge is to understand how changing environmental conditions influence processes across levels of ecological organization. While direct scaling from individual to ecosystem dynamics can lead to robust and mechanistic predictions, new approaches are needed to appropriately translate questions through the community level. Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this scaling through community processes, but predicting how such changes may influence ecosystem function is notoriously difficult. We suggest that community-level dynamics can be incorporated into scaling predictions using a trait-based response-effect framework that differentiates the community response to environmental change (predicted by response traits) and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species' response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of environmental change on function. We then detail several key research directions needed to better scale the effects of environmental change through the community level. These include (1) effect and response trait characterization, (2) linkages between response-and-effect traits, (3) the importance of species interactions on trait expression, and (4) incorporation of feedbacks across multiple temporal scales. Increasing rates of extinction and invasion that are modifying communities worldwide make such a research agenda imperative. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {1. Bees are a functionally important and economically valuable group, but are threatened by land-use conversion and intensification. Such pressures are not expected to affect all species identically; rather, they are likely to be mediated by the species' ecological traits. 2. Understanding which types of species are most vulnerable under which land uses is an important step towards effective conservation planning. 3. We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584 European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70 056 records) and combined them with spe- cies-level ecological trait data. We used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of vegetation), traits and trait 9 land-use interactions, in explaining species occurrence and abundance. 4. Species' sensitivity to land use was most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range, but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban habitats. 5. Synthesis and applications. Rather than targeting particular species or settings, conserva- tion actions may be more effective if focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and negatively interact with land-use pressures. We find evidence that low-intensity agriculture can maintain relatively diverse bee communities; in more intensive settings, added floral resources may be beneficial, but will require careful placement with respect to foraging ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of semi-natural habitats is essential, however; in par- ticular, conversion to urban environments could have severe effects on bee diversity and polli- nation services. Our results highlight the importance of exploring how ecological traits mediate species responses to human impacts, but further research is needed to enhance the predictive ability of such analyses.},

Substrate nitrate (0.116.4?mg?kg-1) and ammonium concentrations (1.39.2?mg?kg-1) in this study were higher than those in other comparable biodiversity experiments. Substrate nitrate concentration significantly increased while ammonium concentration significantly decreased with the increase of plant SR (p?=?0.008 and 0.040, respectively). The response of ecosystem productivity to increasing SR was unimodal with four species per plot achieving the greatest productivity. Transgressive overyielding, which was compared to the most productive of corresponding monocultures, did not occur in most polycultures. We conclude that substrate N retention was enhanced by plant SR even with high N input, and plant SR could be managed to improve the efficiency of N removals in CWs for wastewater treatment.},

abstract = {1 If different factors inhibiting plant growth, e.g. low rainfall or low soil nutrients, were to select for species that have similar constellations of traits, then the unfavourable factors might usefully be grouped together as 'stress'. 2 We offer a method for assessing this issue. A species mixture at a site is described by a point on a plane with two traits as axes. Change along an environmental gradient is then represented as a trajectory across the trait-plane. Trajectories along different environmental gradients are compared. 3 We measured leaf width, specific leaf area (SLA) and mature canopy height for the 386 perennial species found at 46 sites spread along rainfall and soil total phosphorus gradients in south-eastern Australia. Each trait was lognormally distributed across species within sites, hence the mean of log10(trait) satisfactorily described the species mixture at each site. 4 Combinations of assemblage-mean leaf width with SLA followed similar trajectories as rainfall and soil total P decreased. For these traits in this setting, the method indicated that low rainfall and low soil P favour similar trait-combinations. 5 Mature plant height also decreased along both rainfall and soil P gradients, and thus was positively correlated with leaf width and SLA at the level of assemblage means. The rainfall trajectories involving height behaved differently from the soil P trajectories, especially at rainfalls below c. 400 mm year22121, where assemblage-mean height declined much further than at low soil P. 6 Across all species, traits were only very loosely correlated (r2 from 0.04 to 0.17). For leaf width and SLA, evolutionary divergences were positively correlated, both before and after cross-correlation with divergence in rainfall and soil P was removed. This latter measures evolutionary divergence correlation within habitat. For height the picture was more complicated. Considering these within-habitat divergence correlations, species that were taller at maturity tended to have lower SLA and leaf width. This pattern is the reverse of the broad geographical correlation of assemblage means, showing that the patterns across assemblages result from species being selectively sifted from the regional flora into sites, not from evolutionary or cross-species correlations. 7 The trait-combination trajectory approach showed some commonalities between low soil nutrient and low rainfall habitats with regard to traits favoured in species occurring there, but also some differences. The approach has potential for clarifying which environmental factors can usefully be grouped together as 'stress', and which trait combinations can usefully be regarded as part of a syndrome favoured by stress.},

To this aim, MFC were implemented in a pilot plant based on two HSSF CW, one fed with primary settled wastewater (Settler line) and the other fed with the effluent of a hydrolytic up-flow sludge blanket reactor (HUSB line). The eubacterial and archaeal community was profiled on wetland gravel, MFC electrodes and primary treated wastewater by means of 16S rRNA gene-based 454-pyrosequencing and qPCR of 16S rRNA and mcrA genes. Maximum current (219 mA/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and power (36 mW/m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) densities were obtained for the HUSB line. Power production pattern correlated well with water level fluctuations within the wetlands, whereas the type of primary treatment implemented had a significant impact on the diversity and relative abundance of eubacteria communities colonizing MFC. It is worth noticing the high predominance (13-16{\%} of relative abundance) of one OTU belonging to Geobacter on active MFC of the HUSB line that was absent for the settler line MFC. Hence, MFC show promise for power production in constructed wetlands receiving the effluent of a HUSB reactor.},

Extent of green area was positively correlated with visits by all species, by bees, and by Bombus pascuorum, but negatively with bees excluding the main visitor. The correlation increased with scale for all four variables, and the strongest correlations were found for B. pascuorum. The direction of correlation between edge density and the visitation variables was similar as for green area, but showed considerable variation at scales below 100. m radius. Visits by all bees and all visitors to T. pratense were negatively affected by flowering plant species diversity. There was a positive interaction between extent of green area and plant diversity on bee visitation, and a negative interaction between the extent of green area and heterospecific flowers for bees (excluding B. pascuorum). Increasing floral abundance and plant diversity reduced pollinator visitation to T. pratense, suggesting competitive effects through both quantity and diversity of resources. Competition for flower visitors was mainly from Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, both of which frequently co-occurred with T. pratense. We conclude that T. pratense competes for pollinators with other co-occurring plants, but that the nature of the surrounding urban matrix mediates interactions among plant species for pollinator services at different scales, particularly with respect to the proportion of green areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

abstract = {Abstract. Three common Appalachian plant species (Juncus effusus L., Scirpus validus L., and Typha latifolia L.) were planted into small-scale constructed wetlands receiving primary treated wastewater. The experimental design included two wetland gravel depths (45 and 60 cm) and five planting treatments (each species in monoculture, an equal mixture of the three species, and controls without vegetation), with two replicates per depth  planting combination. Inflow rates (19 L day−1) and frequency (3 times day−1) were designed to simulate full-scale constructed wetlands as currently used for domestic wastewater treatment in West Virginia. Influent wastewater and the effluent from each wetland were sampled monthly for ten physical, chemical and biological parameters, and plant demographic measurements were made. After passing through these trough wetlands, the average of all treatments showed a 70{\%} reduction in total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 50 to 60{\%} reduction in nitrogen (TKN), ammonia and phosphate, and a reduction of fecal coliforms by three orders of magnitude. Depth of gravel (45 or 60 cm) had little effect on wetland treatment ability, but did influence Typha and Scirpus growth patterns. Gravel alone provided significant wastewater treatment, but vegetation further improved many treatment efficiencies. Typha significantly out-performed Juncus and Scirpus both in growth and in effluent quality improvement. There was also some evidence that the species mixture out-performed species monocultures. Typha was the superior competitor in mixtures, but a decline in Typha growth with distance from the influent pipe suggested that nutrients became limiting or toxicities may have developed.},

abstract = {We studied changes in the composition of butterfly and burnet fauna in 25 reserves of xeric grasslands within the city Prague, Czech Republic, based on a recent repetition of a survey conducted three decades ago. The past and recent survey detected 91 and 84 species, 12 species were lost and four were gained between the surveys. There was no significant change in mean numbers of species per reserve or in mean species incidences, even if the categories of the habitat association, mobility and body size were analysed separately. Contrary to these comparisons, ordination analyses indicated a significant shift in species composition in individual reserves. Species of short-sward xeric grasslands tended to be associated with the past survey, whereas species of taller grasslands and xeric scrub were associated with recent survey. These shifts were more prominent in large reserves with high proportion of natural (as opposed to urban) perimeter, connected with other reserves, having diverse topography and high plant and biotope richness. We interpret this by gradual successional changes which affect the reserves despite conservation management. Despite these changes, butterfly losses were lower than in comparable surveys recently conducted elsewhere in Central Europe, partly because major losses occurred long before the 1980s survey and partly owing to a high heterogeneity of the urban landscape surrounding the reserves. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Loss of biological diversity because of extinction is one of the most pronounced changes to the global environment. For several decades, researchers have tried to understand how changes in biodiversity might impact biomass production by examining how biomass correlates with a number of biodiversity metrics (especially the number of species and functional groups). This body of research has focused on species with the implicit assumption that they are independent entities. However, functional and ecological similarities are shaped by patterns of common ancestry, such that distantly related species might contribute more to production than close relatives, perhaps by increasing niche breadth. Here, we analyze 2 decades of experiments performed in grassland ecosystems throughout the world and examine whether the evolutionary relationships among the species comprising a community predict how biodiversity impacts plant biomass production. We show that the amount of phylogenetic diversity within communities explained significantly more variation in plant community biomass than other measures of diversity, such as the number of species or functional groups. Our results reveal how evolutionary history can provide critical information for understanding, predicting, and potentially ameliorating the effects of biodiversity loss and should serve as an impetus for new biodiversity experiments.},

abstract = {The variability of bee communities along an urban gradient has a potentially strong impact on pollinator- plant interactions. We investigated changes in bee species richness and community composition in the city centre and suburbs of Poznan´, Poland. During 2006–2008 we recorded 2,495 individuals from 104 species. The most abundant species was Andrena haemmorhoa. Other abundant species were Bombus pascuorum, Andrena vaga, Andrena nitida, Bombus terrestris. Several species appeared to be more abundant in the city centre whereas others showed an opposite tendency. We have found that the urbanized landscape can act as a filter for the bee community since some specific ecological traits facilitate colonization of the city centre. Small-bodied species that start their activity later in the season and are not solitary preferred the city centre. However, bee species diversity and richness remained stable across the urban gradient indicating some advantages of being a city dwelling bee. We suggest that a city can be a very important habitat for a diverse bee fauna and that conservation of a wide range of habitats of different urbanization levels seems to be the most suitable strategy for conservation of bee diversity in cities.},

abstract = {A green roof is a vegetated roof or deck designed to provide urban greening for buildings, people, or the environment. Made popular across Europe over the past few decades, green roofs are now becoming more familiar to North Americans as some cities have built green roof pilot projects and adopted incentives for using green roofs or even require their use. Green roof standards and guidelines are also emerging to be used for governance and project specification. Although much is known about the application of green roofs across Europe, much less is known about their application across North America's diverse ecological regions. When considering the many decisions required in applying green roof technology to a specific place, there are few choices more critical to their success than the selection of appropriate vegetation. We conducted a review of green roof research to investigate what is known about the application of plants on green roofs across North America and their ecological implications. Results indicate that investigation sites across ecoregions begin to reveal differences in plant survival. Although ecological investigations are limited, their results show improved plant performance and ecological services with diverse green roofs. We conclude that as green roofs continue to become regulated and adopted in policy, further development of standards and guidelines is needed. To date, there is no common ground for reporting of green roof research, and we make recommendations for facilitating such efforts for improved research, policy development and their management across North America's diverse ecological regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Most ecological processes and interactions depend on scales much larger than a single habitat, and therefore it is important to link spatial patterns and ecological processes at a landscape scale. Here, we analyzed the effects of landscape context on the distribution of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) at multiple spatial scales with respect to the following hypotheses: (1) Local abundance and diversity of bees increase with increasing proportion of the surrounding seminatural habitats. (2) Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape context at different spatial scales. We selected 15 landscape sectors and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250–3000 m) by field inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic Information Systems. The percentage of semi-natural habitats varied between 1.4{\%} and 28{\%}. In the center of each landscape sector a patch of potted flowering plants (four perennial and two annual species) was placed in the same habitat type, a grassy field margin adjacent to cereal fields. In all, 865 wild bee individuals and 467 honey bees were observed and an additional 475 individuals were caught for species identification. Species richness and abundance of solitary wild bees showed a close positive correlation with the percentage of seminatural habitats at small scales up to 750 m, whereas bumble bees and honey bees did not respond to landscape context at these scales. In contrast, honey bees were correlated with landscape context at large scales. The densities of flower-visiting honey bees even increased with decreasing proportion of seminatural habitats at a radius of 3000 m. We are not aware of any empirical studies showing contrasting foraging patterns related to landscape context at different spatial scales. We conclude (1) that local landscape destruction affects solitary wild bees more than social bees, possibly changing mutualistic plant–pollinator and competitive wild bees– honey bees interactions and (2) that only analyses of multiple spatial scales may detect the importance of the landscape context for local pollinator communities.},

During the 1990s constructed wetlands were also used to treat effluents from textile and wine industries or water from recirculating fish and shrimp aquacultures. The most recent applications include those for brewery or tannery wastewaters as well as olive mills effluents. The survey revealed that both subsurface and surface flow constructed wetlands have been used for treatment of industrial wastewaters. Within subsurface flow constructed wetlands both horizontal and vertical flow systems have been designed. Also, the use of various hybrid constructed wetlands for industrial effluent treatment has been reported in the literature recently.

abstract = {Urban areas are among the most heavily managed landscapes in the world, yet they harbor a remarkable richness of species. Private yards are common habitats in urban areas and are places where cultivated species manage to escape cultivation and become part of the spontaneous species pool. Yards are novel ecosystems where community assembly is driven by both natural and anthropogenic processes. Phylogenetic diversity and functional traits are increasingly recognized as critical to understanding processes of community assembly. Recent evidence indicates that urban areas may select more closely related plant species from the pool of regionally occurring species than do nonurban areas, and that exotic species are phylogenetically clustered within communities. We tested whether phylogenetic diversity and functional trait composition in privately managed yards change along a gradient of housing density in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolis, Minnesota, USA, in accordance with these predictions. We also identified characteristics of the spontaneous yard flora by comparing its phylogenetic diversity and functional composition with the ‘‘natural-areas'' species pool represented by the flora of nearby Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. Along the urbanization gradient, yards had more species per hectare in densely built regions than in lower-density regions, but phylogenetic diversity and functional composition did not change with housing density. In contrast, in comparison to species in natural areas, yard species were more closely related to each other and functionally distinct: They were more often short-lived, self-compatible, and had higher specific leaf area than species of Cedar Creek. The high number of exotic yard species increased the yard flora's phylogenetic relatedness in comparison to species of Cedar Creek, causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners' preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries, their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in comparison to species of Cedar Creek, causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners' preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries, their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in urban environments and beyond, such as accelerating decomposition rates. Limited phylogenetic diversity may reduce the potential of ecosystems to respond to environmental changes. As cities continue to expand globally, understanding the impacts of yard management for biodiversity and ecosystem services becomes increasingly important.},

abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems support size structured food webs, wherein predator- prey body sizes span orders of magnitude. As such, these food webs are replete with extremely generalized feeding strategies, especially among the larger bodied, higher trophic position taxa. The movement scale of aquatic organisms also generally increases with body size and trophic position. Together, these body size, mobility, and foraging relationships suggest that organisms lower in the food web generate relatively distinct energetic pathways by feeding over smaller spatial areas. Concurrently, the potential capacity for generalist for- aging and spatial coupling of these pathways often increases, on average, moving up the food web toward higher trophic levels. We argue that these attributes make for a food web architecture that is inherently ‘adaptive' in its response to environmental conditions. This is because variation in lower trophic level dynamics is dampened by the capacity of predators to fl exibly alter their foraging behavior. We argue that empirical, theoretical, and applied research needs to embrace this inherently adaptive architecture if we are to understand the relationship between structure and function in the face of ongoing envi- ronmental change. Toward this goal, we discuss empirical patterns in the structure of lake food webs to suggest that ecosystems change consistently, from individual traits to the structure of whole food webs, under changing environmental conditions. We then explore an empirical example to reveal that explicitly unfolding the mechanisms that drive these adaptive responses offers insight into how human- driven impacts, such as climate change, invasive species, and fi sheries harvest, ought to infl uence ecosystem structure and function (e.g., stability, secondary productivity, maintenance of major energy pathways).

We investigated species richness and community functional structure of species assemblages at the landscape scale (1km2 plots) for two contrasting model taxa, i.e., plants (producers and sessile organisms) and birds (consumers and mobile organisms), along topography, climate, landscape heterogeneity, and land-use (agriculture and urbanization) gradients in a densely populated region of Switzerland. Our study revealed that agricultural and urban land uses drove marked shifts in the functional structure of biological communities compared to changes along climate and topography gradients, especially for plants, while for birds these changes were comparable. Agricultural and urban land uses enhanced divergence in traits related to resource use for birds (diet and nesting), growth forms, dispersal, and reproductive traits for plants, while it induced convergence in vegetative plant traits (plant height and leaf dry matter content). These results suggest that contrasting assembly patterns may arise within and across taxonomic groups along the same environmental gradients as result of distinct underlying processes and ‘organism-specific' environmental perceptions. Our results further suggest a potential homogenization of biological communities, as well as low functional diversity and redundancy levels of bird assemblages in our human-dominated study region. This might potentially compromise the maintenance of key ecological processes under future environmental changes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We tested predictions of the relative changes in plant leaf traits in response to land uses in Australian eucalypt grassy ecosystems. Predictions were determined from responses observed in European landscapes in relation to disturbances associated with agricultural land uses. We measured specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) across five land uses: reference sites (closest to pre-European state), native pastures (unfertilized), fertilized pastures, sown pastures (cultivated and fertilized) and enriched grassland (previously fertilized, no longer grazed). Leaves were expected to have higher SLA and lower LMDC at sites with increasing fertility and/or disturbance. The predictions were confirmed, with SLA increasing progressively in land uses associated with (1) grazing; (2) grazing and fertilization; (3) grazing, fertilization and cultivation. Values for LDMC were closely (but inversely) correlated with those of SLA. For both traits, there were relationships with available soil phosphorus but not with soil total nitrogen. The positive correlation of SLA with phosphorus was not evident above 30 mg kg-1, the recommended level of phosphorus for improved pastures. Results confirm patterns of leaf-trait response to disturbance that reflect fundamental constraints to plant survival in habitats with different levels of resources and disturbances. A conservative strategy for low productivity undisturbed habitats is associated with low SLA and high dry matter content in contrast to fertile disturbed habitats which select for high SLA and low dry matter content. The changes in leaf traits across land uses resulted from species substitution rather than variation within species across sites, and most notably the replacement of native by annual exotic species as land use intensifies. Recommended fertilization rates for pasture production convert the ground layer to plants with soft, digestible leaves, that are responsive to fertilizer and desirable for livestock production. However, fertilization also drastically reduces the diversity of native plants and annual plants tend to dominate. The trade-off associated with high production includes increased vulnerability to soil erosion, due to reduced plant cover and low persistence of cover. If alternative ecosystem values such as erosion control, water quality, salinity control and biodiversity persistence are required, incentives may be needed to offset the loss of production that can be gained from fertilizer application.

abstract = {Constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow (HF CWs) have been used for wastewater treatment for more than 30 years. Most HF CWs have been designed to treat municipal or domestic wastewater. Nowadays, municipal HF CWs focus not only on common pollutants but also on special parameters such as pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptive chemicals or linear alkylbenzensulfonates (LAS). At present, HF CWs are used to treat many other types of wastewater. Industrial applications include wastewaters from oil refineries, chemical factories, pulp and paper production, tannery and textile industries, abattoir, distillery and winery industries. In particular, the use of HF CWs is becoming very common for treatment of food-processing wastewaters (e.g., production and processing of milk, cheese, potatoes, sugar). HF constructed wetlands are also successfully used to treat wastewaters from agriculture (e.g., pig and dairy farms, fish farm effluents) and various runoff waters (agriculture, airports, highway, greenhouses, plant nurseries). HF CWs have also effectively been used to treat landfill leachate. Besides the use as a single unit, HF CWs are also used in combination with other types of constructed wetlands in hybrid systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Tscharntke1998b,
abstract = {1. Results from four field studies show that communities of trap-nesting bees and wasps and their natural enemies are promising bioindicators for ecological change or habitat quality. These small and easy-to-handle communities can be analysed with respect to (i) species richness and related parameters, and (ii) ecological functions or interactions. The communities comprise Hymenoptera (Apidae, Sphecidae, Eumenidae, Pompilidae) and natural enemies belonging to many insect taxa. Traps consisted of 150-200, 15-20-cm long, reed internodes, put into tins or plastic tubes of 13-15 cm diameter; wooden posts with 2-10 of such reed-filled tins were exposed in the target habitat. 2. Species richness and abundance of bees (but not wasps) were closely related to plant species richness of the habitat, a measure of the bees' food resource. However, availability of nest sites of above-ground nesting species was equally important: meadows with old trees supported greater populations than meadows without trees. A threefold increase in exposed traps resulted in a twofold increase in species. 3. The sensitivity of this bioindicator system profits from the fact that evaluations rely not only on presence/absence data, descriptive population attributes or diversity indices, but also on interactions or ecological functions. Monitoring ecological responses or multitrophic interactions, and their relationship to species diversity, is rarely done but much needed. Ecological functions include (i) the percentage mortality of trap-nesting bees and wasps due to parasitoids and predators, which was correlated with the species richness of these natural enemies; (ii) seed set of allogamous plants due to successful pollination by trap-nesting bees; and (iii) biological control by the predacious wasps. 4. With increasing isolation of fragmented habitats (when traps were exposed in a cleared agricultural landscape), both species richness of natural enemies and percentage mortality (parasitism and predation) declined signicantly. In a comparison of habitat types (grasslands and field margins), species richness of the trap-nest community correlated with plant diversity, but percentage mortality, due to parasitism and predation, with field age only. The threshold distance to the nearest habitat was 106-530 m for a 10-50{\%} decrease in mean mortality, and the mortality increased greatly in habitats that were older than 5 years. Accordingly, these studies emphasize the significance of a continuum of old habitat patches for the augmentation of natural enemies. 5. Exposure of standardized traps is an experimental approach with a small, interacting and reproducing community that can be easily characterized by simple parameters. Taxonomy and biology are well known, and quick evaluations can be done using the close correlation between the number of occupied traps and species richness. Species richness of trap-nesting bees and wasps was closely correlated with that sampled by sweep nets. Further criteria of indicator taxa that apply to this system are discussed in the text.},

Ecologists use plant species traits as generic predictors of geographical distribution, interactions with other species, and ecosystem functioning, but this approach has been little used to optimize engineered ecosystems. Four plant species traits (height, individual leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) were evaluated as predictors of ecosystem properties and services in a modular green roof system planted with 21 species. Six indicators of ecosystem services, incorporating thermal, hydrological, water quality, and carbon sequestration functions, were predicted by the four plant traits directly or indirectly via their effects on aggregate ecosystem properties, including canopy density and albedo. Species average height and specific leaf area were the most useful traits, predicting several services via effects on canopy density or growth rate. This study demonstrates that easily measured plant traits can be used to select species to optimize green roof performance across multiple key services.},

abstract = {During the last decades, describing, analysing and understanding the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages has been a central theme in both community ecology and macro-ecology. Among the wide variety of phylogenetic structure metrics, three have been predominant in the literature: Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PDFaith), which represents the sum of the branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree linking all species of a particular assemblage, the mean pairwise distance between all species in an assemblage (MPD) and the pairwise distance between the closest relatives in an assemblage (MNTD). Comparisons between studies using one or several of these metrics are difficult because there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the phylogenetic properties each metric captures. In particular it is unknown how PDFaith relates to MDP and MNTD. Consequently, it is possible that apparently opposing patterns in different studies might simply reflect differences in metric properties. Here, we aim to fill this gap by comparing these metrics using simulations and empirical data. We first used simulation experiments to test the influence of community structure and size on the mismatch between metrics whilst varying the shape and size of the phylogenetic tree of the species pool. Second we investigated the mismatch between metrics for two empirical datasets (gut microbes and global carnivoran assemblages). We show that MNTD and PDFaith provide similar information on phylogenetic structure, and respond similarly to variation in species richness and assemblage structure. However, MPD demonstrate a very different behaviour, and is highly sensitive to deep branching structure. We suggest that by combining complementary metrics that are sensitive to processes operating at different phylogenetic depths (i.e. MPD and MNTD or PDFaith) we can obtain a better understanding of assemblage structure.},
annote = {- considered phylogenetic distances between species as a substitute for niche differenes (hotly debated though)
- usual expectation: competition-driven coexistence will generate patterns of phylogenetic 'over-dispersion'
- hot debate, but we do see nonrandom phylogenetic community structure
- to test for phylogenetic structures, a lot of metrics have been created; MPD, PD and MNTD are commonly used, and represent different 'phylogenetic' dimensions
- MPD may be more sensitive to basal structure, while MNTD is influenced by the terminal structure
- depends on phylogenetic scale as well, species poor communities likely have less complex structures that are more easily detected by all three metrics},

abstract = {Although urbanization is increasing worldwide, relatively few studies have investigated patterns of urban biodiversity outside of city parks and reserves, in urban neighborhoods where people live and work. We evaluated models including local and landscape factors that might influence the bee and butterfly richness of community gardens located within densely populated neighborhoods of the Bronx and East Harlem in New York City ({\textgreater}10,000 people/km2). The gardens were surrounded by buildings and limited amounts of green space (3,600–17,400 building units and 10–32{\%} green space within a 500 m radius). Contrary to our initial prediction that landscape green space might be especially influential in this heavily urbanized setting, the most highly supported models for both bee and butterfly richness (based on Akaike Information Criterion) included just the local, within-garden variables of garden floral area and sunlight availability. There was marginal support for models of bee richness including the number of building units surrounding gardens within a 500 m radius (which exhibited a negative association with bee richness). In addition, perhaps because bees are central place foragers that may nest within or near gardens, supported models of bee species richness also included total garden area, canopy cover, and the presence of wild/unmanaged area in the garden. Generally, our findings indicate that sunlight and floral abundance are the major factors limiting local pollinator diversity in this setting. This suggests that rooftop and other “open” urban habitats might be managed to increase local pollinator diversity, even if seemingly “isolated” within heavily developed neighborhoods.},

Functional traits are receiving increasing attention as the main ecological attributes by which different organisms and biological communities influence ecosystem services through their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here we synthesize concepts and empirical evidence on linkages between functional traits and ecosystem services across different trophic levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed considered plants and soil invertebrates, but quantitative trait–service associations have been documented for a range of organisms and ecosystems, illustrating the wide applicability of the trait approach. Within each trophic level, specific processes are affected by a combination of traits while particular key traits are simultaneously involved in the control of multiple processes. These multiple associations between traits and ecosystem processes can help to identify predictable trait–service clusters that depend on several trophic levels, such as clusters of traits of plants and soil organisms that underlie nutrient cycling, herbivory, and fodder and fibre production. We propose that the assessment of trait–service clusters will represent a crucial step in ecosystem service monitoring and in balancing the delivery of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, services in ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Sulfate in effluent is a challenging issue for wastewater reuse around the world. In this study, sulfur (S) removal and transformation in five batch constructed wetlands (CWs) treating secondary effluent were investigated. The results showed that the presence of the plant cattail (Typha latifolia) had little effect on sulfate removal, while the carbon-rich litter it generated greatly improved sulfate removal, but with limited sulfide accumulation in the pore-water. After sulfate removal, most of the S was deposited with the valence states S (-II) and S (0) on the iron-rich gravel surface, and acid volatile sulfide was the main S sink in the litter-added CWs. High-throughput pyrosequencing revealed that sulfate-reducing bacteria (i.e. Desulfobacter) and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (i.e. Thiobacillus) were dominant in the litter-added CWs, which led to a sustainable S cycle between sulfate and sulfide. Overall, this study suggests that recycling plant litter and iron-rich filling material in CWs gives an opportunity to utilize the S in the wastewater as both an electron acceptor for sulfate reduction and as an electron donor for nitrate reduction coupled with sulfide oxidation. This leads to the simultaneous removal of sulfate, nitrate, and organics without discharging toxic sulfide into the receiving water body.},

We studied the ecology and behavior of bobcats ( Lynx rufus ) and coyotes ( Canis latrans ) relative to development in a fragmented landscape in southern California from 1996 to 2000. We captured and radiocollared 50 bobcats and 86 coyotes, determined home ranges for 35 bobcats and 40 coyotes, and measured their exposure to development ( “urban association” ) as the percentage of each home range composed of developed or modified areas. Both species occupied predominantly natural home ranges. Adult female bobcats had low levels of urban association, significantly lower than coyotes, adult male bobcats, and young female bobcats. Home-range size was positively correlated with urban association for coyotes and adult male and young female bobcats, suggesting that human-dominated areas were less suitable than natural areas in some important way. Animals more associated with non-natural areas had higher levels of night activity, and both bobcats and coyotes were more likely to be in developed areas at night than during the day. Survival rates were relatively high and were not related to urban association, at least for animals  6–9 months of age. Mortality rates from human-related causes such as vehicle collisions and incidental poisoning were also independent of urban association. In this region, even the few animals that had almost no human development within their home range were vulnerable to human-related mortality. Carnivore conservation in urban landscapes must account for these mortality sources that influence the entire landscape, including reserves. For bobcats, preserving open space of sufficient quantity and quality for adult females is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about carnivores is also critical for conserving populations in urban areas.},

abstract = {Society is increasingly concerned with declining wild bee populations. Although most bees nest in the ground, considerable effort has centered on installing 'bee hotels'-also known as nest boxes or trap nests-which artificially aggregate nest sites of above ground nesting bees. Campaigns to 'save the bees' often promote these devices despite the absence of data indicating they have a positive effect. From a survey of almost 600 bee hotels set up over a period of three years in Toronto, Canada, introduced bees nested at 32.9{\%} of sites and represented 24.6{\%} of more than 27,000 total bees and wasps recorded (47.1{\%} of all bees recorded). Native bees were parasitized more than introduced bees and females of introduced bee species provisioned nests with significantly more female larva each year. Native wasps were significantly more abundant than both native and introduced bees and occupied almost 3/4 of all bee hotels each year; further, introduced wasps were the only group to significantly increase in relative abundance year over year. More research is needed to elucidate the potential pitfalls and benefits of using bee hotels in the conservation and population dynamics of wild native bees.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the growth, community structure, and nutrient removal rates between monoculture and mixed wetlands, based on the hypothesis that it depends on the plant species used in the wetlands as to whether monoculture or mixed wetland is superior in plant growth and nutrient removal. Pilot-scale monoculture and mixed constructed wetlands were studied over 4 years. The monoculture wetland had a community height similar to the mixed wetland during the early years but a significantly lower height than the mixed wetland (P{\textless}0.05) during the last year. The mixed wetland also displayed a higher plant density than the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The leaf area index in the monoculture wetland was significantly higher in the first year (P{\textless}0.05) and significantly lower in the later years (P{\textless}0.05) than that in the mixed wetland. The monoculture wetland had a similar vertical distribution of below-ground biomass over 4 years, while the mixed wetland showed a significant change in vertical distribution of below-ground biomass in the last 2 years. The monoculture wetland had a larger (P{\textless}0.05) above-ground biomass and a similar leaf biomass in the first year, and a smaller above-ground biomass (P{\textless}0.05) and a smaller leaf biomass (P{\textless}0.05) than the mixed wetland during the latter 2 years. The amount of standing dead mass was smaller in the mixed wetland than in the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The mixed wetland exhibited a significantly lower NH4-N removal rate in the first year (P{\textless}0.05), and significantly higher NH4-N removal rate in the last year, when compared to the monoculture wetland (P{\textless}0.05). The study indicated that species competition and stubble growth resulted in significant differences between monoculture and mixed constructed wetlands in plant growth, community structure, and nutrient removal rates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

abstract = {Most biodiversity experiments have been conducted in grassland ecosystems with nitrogen limitation, while little research has been conducted on relationships between plant biomass production, substrate nitrogen retention and plant diversity in wetlands with continuous nitrogen supply. We conducted a plant diversity experiment in a subsurface vertical flow constructed wetland for treating domestic wastewater in southeastern China. Plant aboveground biomass production ranged from 20 to 3121gm-2yr-1across all plant communities. In general, plant biomass production was positively correlated with species richness (P=0.001) and functional group richness (P=0.001). Substrate nitrate concentration increased significantly with increasing plant species richness (P=0.046), but not with functional group richness (P=0.550). Furthermore, legumes did not affect biomass production (P=0.255), retention of substrate nitrate (P=0.280) and ammonium (P=0.269). Compared to the most productive of the corresponding monocultures, transgressive overyielding of mixed plant communities did not occur in most polycultures. Because greater diversity of plant community led to higher biomass production and substrate nitrogen retention, thus we recommend that plant biodiversity should be incorporated in constructed wetlands to improve wastewater treatment efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Green roofs are often planted with multiple species to improve aesthetics and other ecosystem services. If diverse species mixtures contain species with phenological differences in growth and reproduction, this could enhance ecosystem functioning by increasing the duration over which a valuable process operates. Phenological complementarity describes a species mixture where plant growth or reproduction is more evenly spread over time among species than predicted by chance. Here we report general phenological patterns of growth and reproduction from the third year of a four-year modular green roof experiment involving 13 species from five life form groups, planted in mixtures and monocultures. The relationships between phenological complementarity in canopy density (a surrogate for aboveground biomass) in species mixtures and thermal and hydrological functions were determined for the fourth year of the study.Timing of peak growth occurred from May to July, differing greatly among species. Flowering times also differed among species and occurred from May to October. Six species showed variation in phenology depending on whether they were planted in monocultures or species mixtures, suggesting competitive or facilitative interactions with other species. Phenological complementarity in canopy density was observed in four of the species mixture treatments, with mixtures of species from the same life form tending to have the highest complementarity values. Phenological complementarity was weakly negatively correlated with the temporal coefficient of variation in stormwater capture, indicating the potential for greater process stability over time in complementary mixtures.},

@article{Lavorel2002,
abstract = {1. The concept of plant functional type proposes that species can be grouped accord- ing to common responses to the environment and/or common effects on ecosystem processes. However, the knowledge of relationships between traits associated with the response of plants to environmental factors such as resources and disturbances (response traits), and traits that determine effects of plants on ecosystem functions (effect traits), such as biogeochemical cycling or propensity to disturbance, remains rudimentary. 2. We present a framework using concepts and results from community ecology, ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to provide this linkage. Ecosystem func- tioning is the end result of the operation of multiple environmental filters in a hierarchy of scales which, by selecting individuals with appropriate responses, result in assem- blages with varying trait composition. Functional linkages and trade-offs among traits, each of which relates to one or several processes, determine whether or not filtering by different factors gives a match, and whether ecosystem effects can be easily deduced from the knowledge of the filters. 3. To illustrate this framework we analyse a set of key environmental factors and ecosystem processes. While traits associated with response to nutrient gradients strongly overlapped with those determining net primary production, little direct overlap was found between response to fire and flammability. 4. We hypothesize that these patterns reflect general trends. Responses to resource availability would be determined by traits that are also involved in biogeochemical cycling, because both these responses and effects are driven by the trade-off between acquisition and conservation. On the other hand, regeneration and demographic traits associated with response to disturbance, which are known to have little connection with adult traits involved in plant ecophysiology, would be of little relevance to ecosystem processes. 5. This framework is likely to be broadly applicable, although caution must be exer- cised to use trait linkages and trade-offs appropriate to the scale, environmental con- ditions and evolutionary context. It may direct the selection of plant functional types for vegetation models at a range of scales, and help with the design of experimental studies of relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties.},

However, these created ecosystems also provide a range of other benefits, or ecosystem services, which are often acknowledged but rarely quantified. In this study, additional ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and cultural services, were assessed and compared between 20 ponds and 20 CSWs in North Carolina, USA. Carbon sequestration was estimated through the carbon content of pond and wetland sediments across a gradient of system age. Biodiversity was quantified in terms of the richness and Shannon diversity index of vegetative and aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Cultural services were qualitatively assessed based on the potential for recreational and educational opportunities at each site. Ponds and wetlands were found to support similar levels of macroinvertebrate diversity, though differences community composition arose between the two habitat types. CSWs demonstrated greater potential to provide carbon sequestration, vegetative diversity, and cultural ecosystem services. This assessment provides an initial framework upon which future assessments of ecosystem service provision by SCMs can build. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The large effort to compile global plant functional trait databases largely for the purpose of mapping and analyzing the spatial distribution of function has resulted in very sparse data matrices thereby limiting progress. Identifying robust methodologies to gap fill or impute trait values in these databases is an important objective. Here I argue that existing statistical tools from phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to rapidly impute values into global plant functional trait databases due to the large amount of phylogenetic signal often in trait data. In particular, statistical models of phylogenetic signal in traits can be generated from existing data and used to predict missing values of closely related species often with a high degree of accuracy thereby facilitating the continental-scale mapping of plant function. Despite the promise of this approach, I also discuss potential pitfalls and future challenges that will need to be addressed.},

abstract = {In this study, replacement of dominant populations (Phragmites australis and Phalaris arundinacea) in the plant community succession process in the Zhenjiang Waterfront Wetland was approached from three aspects: growth, photosynthesis, and specific competitive characteristics. The productivity of Phragmites, based on intrinsic rate of increase and environmental carrying capacity of the several chosen growth indices (plant length, sheath height, and biomass), was significantly higher than that of Phalaris. Phragmites had a higher photosynthetic rate than Phalaris. However, Phalaris had a markedly lower light compensation point, which suggested that it was capable of better utilization of weak light. This possibly might account for its survival beneath Phragmites. At three different coverage gradients, the relative yield total was greater than 1, indicating a certain degree of complementary resource utilization via niche separation between both species. Significant differences in the competition ratio of both species indicated a superiority of Phragmites over Phalaris in terms of competitive capability. Thus, the Phragmites population tended to exclude the Phalaris population and became the mono-dominant population in the community succession process. For Phalaris, traits such as its better utilization of weak light, its complementary resource utilization, and a partial separation of growth period compared to Phragmites prevented complete replacement of its population to some degree. In this particular study area in the Zhenjiang Waterfront Wetland, the hydrological conditions of the river beach determined by its elevation possibly acted as the dominant regulator of the plant succession process. -{\textregistered} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V},

abstract = {The San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary (SJWS), Irvine, CA, is a 32 ha series of shallow ponds created to maximize nitrate removal rates while maintaining 90{\%} open water and episodically exposed shoreline for avian habitat. Design elements created non-ideal denitrification conditions by diminishing an organic carbon source (emergent vegetation) and increasing sediment exposure to oxygen. SJWS aqueous nitrogen and avian data (1999-2002) were analyzed to discern whether design and operating conditions allowed for simultaneous nitrate removal and diverse, abundant avian habitat. Average TIN removal efficiency was 80{\%} while average TN removal efficiency was 60{\%}; the difference reflects Org-N production in the marsh. Based on Chl-a measurements, roughly 40{\%} of Org-N produced in the system was present as algae. The highest annual nitrate removal rates occurred April-May (350-500 mg/m2/d) and September-October (250-425 mg/m2/d). First order rate constants ranged 30.7-47.5 m year-1. Seasonal plantings of barnyard grass (Echinocloa crus-galli) were intended to serve as a carbon amendment for denitrification, however, there was no difference in nitrate removal between amended and non-amended conditions, likely because data averaging obscured a small, localized enhancement signal. Average avian species richness was high, ranging between 65 and 76 species month-1, while average relative abundance was mid-range, at 65-83 birds ha-1month-1. Birds observed included common and rare species. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Urban particulate pollution in the UK remains at levels which have the potential to cause negative impacts on human health. There is a need, therefore, for mitigation strategies within cities, especially with regards to vehicular sources. The use of vegetation as a passive filter of urban air has been previously investigated, however green roof vegetation has not been specifically considered. The present study aims to quantify the effectiveness of four green roof species - creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera), red fescue (Festuca rubra), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and sedum (Sedum album) - at capturing particulate matter smaller than 10 $\mu$m (PM10). Plants were grown in a location away from major road sources of PM10and transplanted onto two roofs in Manchester city centre. One roof is adjacent to a major traffic source and one roof is characterised more by urban background inputs. Significant differences in metal containing PM10capture were found between sites and between species. Site differences were explained by proximity to major sources. Species differences arise from differences in macro and micro morphology of the above surface biomass. The study finds that the grasses, A. stolonifera and F. rubra, are more effective than P. lanceolata and S. album at PM10capture. Quantification of the annual PM10removal potential was calculated under a maximum sedum green roof installation scenario for an area of the city centre, which totals 325 ha. Remediation of 2.3{\%} (±0.1{\%}) of 9.18 tonnes PM10inputs for this area could be achieved under this scenario. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1 If different factors inhibiting plant growth, e.g. low rainfall or low soil nutrients, were to select for species that have similar constellations of traits, then the unfavourable factors might usefully be grouped together as 'stress'. 2 We offer a method for assessing this issue. A species mixture at a site is described by a point on a plane with two traits as axes. Change along an environmental gradient is then represented as a trajectory across the trait-plane. Trajectories along different environmental gradients are compared. 3 We measured leaf width, specific leaf area (SLA) and mature canopy height for the 386 perennial species found at 46 sites spread along rainfall and soil total phosphorus gradients in south-eastern Australia. Each trait was lognormally distributed across species within sites, hence the mean of log10(trait) satisfactorily described the species mixture at each site. 4 Combinations of assemblage-mean leaf width with SLA followed similar trajectories as rainfall and soil total P decreased. For these traits in this setting, the method indicated that low rainfall and low soil P favour similar trait-combinations. 5 Mature plant height also decreased along both rainfall and soil P gradients, and thus was positively correlated with leaf width and SLA at the level of assemblage means. The rainfall trajectories involving height behaved differently from the soil P trajectories, especially at rainfalls below c. 400 mm year22121, where assemblage-mean height declined much further than at low soil P. 6 Across all species, traits were only very loosely correlated (r2 from 0.04 to 0.17). For leaf width and SLA, evolutionary divergences were positively correlated, both before and after cross-correlation with divergence in rainfall and soil P was removed. This latter measures evolutionary divergence correlation within habitat. For height the picture was more complicated. Considering these within-habitat divergence correlations, species that were taller at maturity tended to have lower SLA and leaf width. This pattern is the reverse of the broad geographical correlation of assemblage means, showing that the patterns across assemblages result from species being selectively sifted from the regional flora into sites, not from evolutionary or cross-species correlations. 7 The trait-combination trajectory approach showed some commonalities between low soil nutrient and low rainfall habitats with regard to traits favoured in species occurring there, but also some differences. The approach has potential for clarifying which environmental factors can usefully be grouped together as 'stress', and which trait combinations can usefully be regarded as part of a syndrome favoured by stress.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was to study the influence of the presence of plants and of plant species on the treatment efficiency of shallow (0.3 m effective depth) horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (CWs) treating diluted municipal wastewater. The pilot plant was situated in A Coru{\~{n}}a (Spain) and constituted of five CW units in parallel: CW1 (unplanted), CW2 (Juncus effusus) CW3 (Iris pseudacorus), CW4 (Typha latifolia L.) and CW5 (Phragmites australis). A long term study (from October 2009 to March 2012) was carried out with five monitoring campaigns during the two first years of operation at low surface loading rate (SLR, 2.5 g BOD5/m2d on average) and two monitoring campaigns during the third year at design SLR (4.7 g BOD5/m2d on average). At low SLR rate, significant differences between units were not found for TSS (89-93{\%}), COD (83-88{\%}) or BOD5(90-95{\%}) percentage removal which, in turn, appeared at design SLR, when BOD5removal decreased to 78{\%} (CW1), 69{\%} (CW4), 87{\%} (CW2), 86{\%} (CW3) and 94{\%} (CW5). Thus, the effect of plants on the removal efficiency of organic matter (COD, BOD5) appeared to be dependent on the loading rate. CW2 reached the highest nitrogen removal, followed by CW4, CW5 and CW3 at a similar level and, finally, by CW1. Results indicate that the additional nitrogen removal rate in planted units increased with plant biomass productivity which also determined evapotranspiration variability between units. Typha latifolia L. appeared to be the most sensitive species to adverse conditions.},

abstract = {1. Fragmentation of natural habitats due to urban development is predicted to have negative impacts on species diversity. The surrounding landscape (or ‘matrix') of urban or semi-natural habitats can sometimes support biodiversity, but the amount of support will depend on species-specific traits, and on the resources available in the fragment and the matrix. 2. Using data on bees collected from 19 oak-savannah fragments, the question of whether bee communities differ when fragments are embedded in different landscapes (Douglas-fir forest vs. urban residential neighbourhoods) was investigated, and also whether these differences could be attributed to species-specific traits of bees (e.g. body size, specialization) and/or within-fragment floral resources. 3. No differences were found in overall richness or abundance of bees, but there were distinct differences in plant and bee community composition between matrix types. Common wood-nesters and late-flying, small-bodied bees tended to be found in urban-associated fragments, which also had a lower availability of within-fragment floral resources. 4. Forest-associated fragments, on the other hand, had a greater density and richness of early-flowering native plant species, and supported a higher abundance of large- bodied bee species. Bumble bee abundance, in particular, increased with increasing proportion of forest cover in the surrounding landscape. 5. Large-bodied bees appear to respond to increased availability of within-fragment floral resources, but it was also hypothesised that nesting and floral resources in matrix habitat drive the differences in bee community assemblages.},

The identification of preferred plant species via morphological characters of the leaf fragments is challenging and direct observation of bees cutting leaves from certain plant species are difficult. As such, data are poor on leaf preference of leafcutting bees. In this study, I use DNA barcoding of the rcbL and ITS2 regions to identify and compare leaf preference of three Megachile bee species widespread in Toronto, Canada. Nests were opened and one leaf piece from one cell per nest of the native M. pugnata Say (N=45 leaf pieces), and the introduced M. rotundata Fabricius (N=64) and M. centuncularis (L.) (N=65) were analysed. From 174 individual DNA sequences, 54 plant species were identified. Preference by M. rotundata was most diverse (36 leaf species, H′=3.08, phylogenetic diversity (pd)=2.97), followed by M. centuncularis (23 species, H′=2.38, pd=1.51) then M. pugnata (18 species, H′=1.87, pd=1.22). Cluster analysis revealed significant overlap in leaf choice of M. rotundata and M. centuncularis. There was no significant preference for native leaves, and only M. centuncularis showed preference for leaves of woody plants over perennials. Interestingly, antimicrobial properties were present in all but six plants collected; all these were exotic plants and none were collected by the native bee, M. pugnata. These missing details in interpreting what bees need offers valuable information for conservation by accounting for necessary (and potentially limiting) nesting materials.},

abstract = {Increased stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces is a major concern in urban areas and green roofs are increasingly used as an innovative means of stormwater management. However, there are very few studies on how different vegetation types affect the amount of water runoff. This paper describes an experiment that investigates the influence of plant species and plant diversity on the amount of water runoff from a simulated green roof. Twelve species were selected from the three major taxonomic and functional plant groups that are commonly used for extensive green roofs (forbs, sedum and grasses). Four species were chosen from each group and planted in combinations of increasing diversity and complexity: monocultures, four-species mixtures and twelve-species mixtures. The results showed that there was a significant difference in amount of water runoff between vegetation types; grasses were the most effective for reducing water runoff, followed by forbs and sedum. It was also shown that the size and structure of plants significantly influenced the amount of water runoff. Plant species with taller height, larger diameter, and larger shoot and root biomass were more effective in reducing water runoff from simulated green roofs than plant species with shorter height, smaller diameter, and smaller shoot and root biomass. The amount of water runoff from Sedum spp. was higher than that from bare ground. Species richness did not affect the amount of water runoff in this study.},

We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these ar- eas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.},

abstract = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67{\%} to 96{\%} but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78{\%} in temperate-zone communities to 94{\%} in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5{\%} of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems},

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ?functional landscape heterogeneity?. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. Keywords},

abstract = {1.Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2.Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3.We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's $\lambda$ performed well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's $\lambda$ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4.Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5.We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6.These guidelines aim to better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades.},

abstract = {With the global loss of natural wetlands, waterbirds have become increasingly dependent on alternative and artificial habitats, but the use of such wetlands by waterbirds is typically opportunistic and little consideration has been given to the potential implications for water treatment or waterbird conservation objectives. Wastewater treatment wetlands are currently of critical importance for certain waterbird species in some parts of the world, and we illustrate this with an example fromsouth-eastern Australia. Furthermore, we argue that their significance is likely to increase as they offer the most realistic means of treating wastewater in developing countries, where the demand for improved sanitation to lift people out of poverty is intense. There is little scientific evidence to guide the construction of wastewater treatment wetlands with waterbird conservation in mind. The use of wastewater by waterbirds poses health risks for both birds and humans and these risks must be better understood. Wastewater treatment wetlands are not a substitute for natural wetlands and reliance upon them should not compromise wetland conservation efforts. Nonetheless, they are a potentially valuable resource for waterbirds, and research should be directed towards deepening our understanding of their global distribution; food-web dynamics; methods of deterring or excluding birds when bird or human health may be compromised; the effects of wastewater contaminants and pathogens on birds; and the role of waterbirds in human disease transmission},

Yet, fundamental interactions between plants and associated microorganisms remain only partly understood. The aim of our project was to evaluate microbial density and activity associated to the rhizosphere of three plant species. Experimental set-up, in six replicates, consisted of four 1.8-L microcosms respectively planted in monoculture of Typha angustifolia, Phragmites australis, Phalaris arundinacea and unplanted control. Plants were grown for two months with 25 L m(-2) d(-1) of secondary effluent (in g m(-2) d(-1): 1.3 TSS, 7.5 COD, 1.0 TKN). Sampling of substrate, roots and interstitial water was made according to depth (0-10, 10-20 cm). Biofilm was extracted with 500 mL of a buffer solution. Microbial density was directly estimated by flow cytometry and indirectly by protein measurements. Biological activity was determined using respirometry assays, dehydrogenase and enzymatic activity measurements. Our results show that microbial density and activity are higher in the presence of plants, with significantly higher values associated with Phalaris arundinacea. Greater density of aerobic or facultative bacteria was present in planted microcosm, particularly on root surface, suggesting root oxygen release. Microbes were present on substrate and roots as an attached biofilm and abundance was correlated to root surface throughout depth. Plant species root morphology and development seem to be a key factor influencing microbial-plant interaction.},

abstract = {Given the predicted expansion of cities throughout the world, understanding the effect of urbanization on bee fauna is a major issue for the conservation of bees. The aim of this study was to understand how urbanization affects wild bee assemblages along a gradient of impervious surfaces and to determine the influence of landscape composition and floral resource availability on these assemblages. We chose 12 sites with a proportion of impervious surfaces (soil covered by parking, roads, and buildings) ranging from 0.06{\%} to 64.31{\%} within a 500 m radius. We collected using pan trapping and estimated the landscape composition of the sites within a 500 m radius and the species richness of plant assemblages within a 200 m radius. We collected 1104 bees from 74 species. The proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale had a negative effect on wild bee abundance and species richness, whereas local flower composition had no effect. Ground-nesting bees were particularly sensitive to the urbanization gradient. This study provides new evidences of the impact of urbanization on bee assemblages and the proportion of impervious surfaces at the landscape scale emerged as a key factor that drives those assemblages.},

Two types of constructed wetlands, sub-surface (SSF) and free water surface (FWS) flow systems, and two more types of algae-based systems, high rate algae ponds (HRAP) and maturation pond (MP) have been studied for two years. All systems treated the same wastewater from a rural locality in Le{\'{o}}n (northwest of Spain). Hydraulic retention time was 3 days for both wetland systems, 20 days for the maturation pond and 10 days for the high rate algae pond. Total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal Streptococci, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococci were analyzed in the influent and effluents of each system. A comparison among the wetland systems showed that SSF were more efficient than FWS system when considering surface removal rates (cfu removed/m2/d). Nevertheless, differences were not statistically significant. Considering mean removal efficiencies (in log unit), results showed that higher reductions were observed in FWS for most of the groups except for clostridia and Staphylococci. Concerning algae-based systems, MP showed higher removal efficiencies than HRAP, getting higher surface removal rates in the HRAP. Generally constructed wetlands were more efficient than algae-based systems when considering both, efficiencies in {\%} and surface removal rates. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2. Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3. In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4. Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5. Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wild bees are important pollinators that have declined in diversity and abundance during the last decades. Habitat destruction and fragmentation associated with urbanization are reported as part of the main causes of this decline. Urbanization involves dramatic changes of the landscape, increasing the proportion of impervious surface while decreasing that of green areas. Few studies have investigated the effects of urbanization on bee communities. We assessed changes in the abundance, species richness, and composition of wild bee community along an urbanization gradient. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Over two years and on a monthly basis, bees were sampled with colored pan traps and insect nets at 24 sites located along an urbanization gradient. Landscape structure within three different radii was measured at each study site. We captured 291 wild bee species. The abundance of wild bees was negatively correlated with the proportion of impervious surface, while species richness reached a maximum at an intermediate (50{\%}) proportion of impervious surface. The structure of the community changed along the urbanization gradient with more parasitic species in sites with an intermediate proportion of impervious surface. There were also greater numbers of cavity-nesting species and long-tongued species in sites with intermediate or higher proportion of impervious surface. However, urbanization had no effect on the occurrence of species depending on their social behavior or body size. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We found nearly a third of the wild bee fauna known from France in our study sites. Indeed, urban areas supported a diverse bee community, but sites with an intermediate level of urbanization were the most speciose ones, including greater proportion of parasitic species. The presence of a diverse array of bee species even in the most urbanized area makes these pollinators worthy of being a flagship group to raise the awareness of urban citizens about biodiversity.},

Trin. ex Steudel and two cyperacean species, viz. Scirpus maritimus L. and S. lacustris L.) was studied in relation to growth responses in the water-depth gradient. Stands of S. lacustris were found at lower depths relative to the mean water level (average fringe depth 69 ± 19 cm) than stands of Phragmites australis (av. 45 ± 20 cm), S. maritimus (av. 36 ± 8 cm) and Phalaris arundinacea (av. 25 ± 8 cm). The growth responses to a gradient of water depth were studied by planting the four species at five distinct water depths in outdoor basins, and determining morphological parameters and biomass distributions of the species grown for two consecutive years. The biomass of Phalaris arundinacea was reduced below 30 cm water depth, while Phragmites australis and S. maritimus showed reduced biomass at 80 cm water depth. S. lacustris showed no biomass reduction even at 80 cm water depth. An increased above-ground: below-ground biomass ratio in deeper water was demonstrated for each of the species under study; however, the modification of biomass distribution in the gramineous species occurred abruptly in very shallow water contrary to the cyperacean species. Mean basal stem diameter increased with water depth in all four species. Mean stem length increased with water depth in three of the four species. Stem elongation with increasing water depth was strongest in the cyperacean species. The gramineous species showed enhanced formation of adventitious roots at submerged nodes. The similarity of responses to water depth was greatest within each of the groups of gramineous and cyperacean species. The responses reflect the zonation of the species along the water- depth gradient: S. lacustris in relatively deep water. Phragmites australis and S. maritimus in shallower water, and Phalaris arundinacea in very shallow water.},

Despite this, no comprehensive account of species in Canada and Alaska has been published. Our objective is to provide an up-to-date revision of the genus Megachile of this region, including an interactive key to the species, and summaries of biogeographic distribution and life history. Additionally, divergence in a 658 bp segment of the mitochondrial COI gene (the “DNA barcode” region) was used to clarify the taxonomic status of several Megachile species in North America. Based on morphological differences and over 6{\%} sequence divergence in COI, M. (Litomegachile) onobrychidis Cockerell, previously considered a subspecies of M. (Litomegachile) brevis Say, is recognized here as a valid species. Similarly, M. (Litomegachile) pseudobrevis Mitchell, found in the southeastern United States, is also considered a distinct species and removed from synonymy with M. brevis. Megachile (Eutricharaea) apicalis Spinola and M. (Megachiloides) casadae Cockerell and M. (Megachiloides) umatillensis (Mitchell) are recorded from Canada for the first time; M. (Xanthosarus) giliae Cockerell and M. (Megachile) nivalis are placed into synonymy with M. (Xanthosarus) circumcincta (Kirby) and M.

Megachile (Megachiloides) alamosana Mitchell, known only from the male, M. (Megachiloides) laurita Mitchell, and M.

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of studying the joint structure of three data tables R, L and Q. In our motivating ecological example, the central table L is a sites-by-species table that contains the number of organisms of a set of species that occurs at a set of sites. At the margins of L are the sites-by-environment data table R and the species-by-trait data table Q. For relating the biological traits of organisms to the characteristics of the environment in which they live, we propose a statistical technique called RLQ analysis (R-mode linked to Q-mode), which consists in the general singular value decomposition of the triplet (R(t)D(I)LD(J)Q,D-q,D-p) where D-I, D-J, D-q, D-p are diagonal weight matrices, which are chosen in relation to the type of data that is being analyzed (quantitative, qualitative, etc.). In the special case where the central table is analysed by correspondence analysis, RLQ maximizes the covariance between linear combinations of columns of R and Q. An example in bird ecology illustrates the potential of this method for community ecologists.},

abstract = {Species enter and persist in local communities because of their ecological fit to local conditions, and recently, ecologists have moved from measuring diversity as species richness and evenness, to using measures that reflect species ecological differences. There are two principal approaches for quantifying species ecological differences: functional (trait-based) and phylogenetic pairwise distances between species. Both approaches have produced new ecological insights, yet at the same time methodological issues and assumptions limit them. Traits and phylogeny may provide different, and perhaps complementary, information about species' differences. To adequately test assembly hypotheses, a framework integrating the information provided by traits and phylogenies is required. We propose an intuitive measure for combining functional and phylogenetic pairwise distances, which provides a useful way to assess how functional and phylogenetic distances contribute to understanding patterns of community assembly. Here, we show that both traits and phylogeny inform community assembly patterns in alpine plant communities across an elevation gradient, because they represent complementary information. Differences in historical selection pressures have produced variation in the strength of the trait-phylogeny correlation, and as such, integrating traits and phylogeny can enhance the ability to detect assembly patterns across habitats or environmental gradients.},

abstract = {This report describes results of a 14 month study of the fate of trace-metal contaminants in wetland microcosms. Duplicated wetland microcosms contained either cattail, Typha domingensis or duckweed, Lemma minor, as the dominant macrophyte. Each wetland microcosm received 14.6 cm/day of dilute landfill leachate amended with lead (measured average: 396 $\mu$g/l) and cadmium (measured average: 105 $\mu$g/l). At intervals of approximately 3 months, sediments and macrophytes were sampled and analyzed for heavy metal content. Differences between measured trace-metal concentrations in inflow and outflow samples indicated that approximately half of the added lead and cadmium were retained in wetland microcosms. Of the fraction removed from the water, less than half could be accounted for in calculated sediment and plant tissue concentrations, based on analysis. The apparent discrepancy in mass balance calculations probably arises from failure to accurately measure bulk density of sediment detritus hoc, which contained a substantial amount of the trace metals. Measurement of sediment acid volatile sulfides (AVS), and comparisons of these concentrations to those of the added lead and cadmium, showed that nearly all of these trace metals were present in the sediments as sulfides, limiting bioavailability and toxicity of these elements. Results of analyses and a lack of overt biological effects suggest that in wetlands containing organic sediments, sediment chemistry dominates cycling of these trace metals. Plant accumulation is of secondary importance. Comparison of heavy-metal uptake by cattails and duckweed shows that duckweed, on a whole plant basis, accumulates lead and cadmium more effectively than does cattail. If plants were to be used in a biomass-harvesting process for metal bioremediation, duckweed appears to be a more suitable candidate than cattail because of high productivity and ease of harvesting, coupled with a significant bioaccumulation of lead and cadmium. Potential metal removal rates by duckweed are 3-8 mg Pb/m2day and 2-4 mg Cd/m2day.},

A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets {\textgreater} or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees.

In a mixed-culture, P. australis demonstrates superiority in terms of competitive interactions for space between plants. Furthermore, the interspecific competition among planted species seemed to cause different ecological responses of plant species in the two CWs. For example, while relatively high density and shoot height determined the high aboveground dry weight of P. australis in the FWS wetland, this association was not evident in the SSF. Additionally, while plants nutrients uptake accounts for a higher proportion of the nitrogen removal in FWS, that in the SSF accounts for a higher proportion of the phosphorous removal.},

abstract = {The analysis of presence-absence matrices with ''null model'' randomization tests has been a major source of controversy in community ecology for over two decades. In this paper, I systematically compare the performance of nine null model algorithms and four co-occurrence indices with respect to Type I and Type II errors. The nine algorithms differ in whether rows and columns are treated as fixed sums, equiprobable, or proportional. The three models that maintain fixed row sums are invulnerable to Type I errors (false positives). One of these three is a modified version of the original algorithm of E. F. Conner and D. Simberloff. Of the four co-occurrence indices, the number of checkerboard combinations and the number of species combinations may be prone to Type II errors (false negatives), and may not reveal significant patterns in noisy data sets. L. Stone and A. Robert's checkerboard score has good power for detecting species pairs that do nut co-occur together frequently, whereas D. Schluter's V ratio reveals nonrandom patterns in the row and column totals of the matrix. Degenerate matrices (matrices with empty rows or columns) do not. Greatly alter the outcome of null model analyses. The choice of an appropriate null model and index may depend on whether the data represent classic ''island lists'' of species in an archipelago or standardized ''sample lists'' of species collected with equal sampling effort. Systematic examination of a set of related null models can pinpoint how violation of the assumptions of the model contributes to nonrandom patterns.},

abstract = {Aim In a selected literature survey we reviewed studies on the habitat heterogeneity–animal species diversity relationship and evaluated whether there are uncertainties and biases in its empirical support. Location World-wide. Methods We reviewed 85 publications for the period 1960–2003. We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study. Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to ‘keystone structures' that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

abstract = {Wetlands provide many ecosystem services to society, most notably the provision of habitat for important plants and animals, the improvement of water quality, and the sequestration of carbon. Nitrogen and phosphorus budgets, vegetation structure and function, and carbon fluxes and accumulation are described for a pair of 1-ha created riverine wetlands in central Ohio USA over 20 years (1994-2013) of primary succession. The primary inflow to these experimental wetlands was from water pumped from the adjacent fourth-order Olentangy River. The pumping rate maintained for most of the years (an exception was a two-year comparison of pulsing and non-pulsing hydrology in the two wetlands in 2004-2005) was according to a pre-determined formula based on river stage. The pumped inflow to the wetlands averaged 38.7±1.5myr-1with precipitation averaging 1.1myr-1for the same years. Surface outflow averaged 27.1±1.4myr-1and subsurface seepage was estimated to be 13.2±0.2myr-1over that period. Both outflows returned water to the Olentangy River via surface and subsurface pathways respectively.Wetland plant richness increased from 13 species initially planted in one of the wetlands to 116 species overall after 17 years, with most of that richness (99 species) occurring in the first 5 years. The planted wetland had higher community diversity every year except one over 20 years while the naturally colonizing wetland was more productive especially in the first 7 years and overall still had 2000. kg more organic matter input by ANPP after 17 years than did the planted wetland.Nutrient mass inflows to the wetlands averaged 5.61±0.30 g-Pm-2yr-1(n=30 wetland years) for total phosphorus, 2.17±0.27g-Pm-2yr-1(n=30 wetland years) for soluble reactive phosphorus, 122±3g-Nm-2yr-1(n=14 wetland years) for total nitrogen, and 100±5g-Nm-2yr-1(n=32 wetland years) for nitrate-nitrogen. Retention rates were 2.40±0.23g-Pm-2yr-1for total phosphorus, 0.87±0.10g-Pm-2yr-1for soluble reactive phosphorus, 38.8±2.2g-Nm-2yr-1for total nitrogen, and 15.6±2.7g-Nm-2yr-1for nitrate-nitrogen. Total phosphorus retention was higher in the planted wetland compared to the natural colonizing wetland (44.3±4.4{\%} vs. 38.8±5.3{\%} respectively; p=0.059) while total nitrogen retention was significantly higher in the naturally colonizing wetland compared to the planted wetland (32.1±2.0{\%} vs. 28.4±2.6{\%} respectively; p=0.000085). Investigation of trends of water quality improvement showed that, overall, nutrient retention decreased from the beginning of the study through the 17th year in 2010. More recent trends showed tendencies for water quality improvement in 9 out of 11 of the nutrient parameters and time periods investigated between 2003 and 2010.The wetlands were effective carbon sinks, with rates of carbon sequestration (219-267g-Cm-2yr-1, higher than those measured in a reference natural flow-through wetland. Both carbon sequestration and methane emissions have been consistently higher in the naturally colonizing wetland, theorized as due to the greater productivity of this wetland over several years in the middle of this study.},

abstract = {1. Current views of anthropogenic environments emphasize the extreme novelty of urban and industrial ecosystems. Proponents of reconciliation ecology argue thatwe need to use such habitats to conserve biodiversity, given the inadequacy of natural reserve systems. 2. Some of the harshest anthropogenic ecosystems may be able to support indigenous biodiversity due to their structural or functional resemblance to natural ecosystems, habitats, or microsites that may be present in the region but not part of the historic ecosystem on a particular site. Here we review recent work that evaluates similarities between urban and industrial ecosystems and natural analogues, and explore the potential for these in reconciliation ecology. 3. We find that artificial habitats represent a gradient of ecological novelty whichmay be indepen- dent of the degree of human influence.While hard-surfaced habitats such as walls and quarries are the most investigated artificial analogues (of natural rock pavements and cliffs), there are many other examples spanning a range of habitats in both terrestrial and marine settings.Analogous eco- systems may be present in the region but limits to dispersal can prevent appropriate species from reaching urban or industrial sites, and small differences in abiotic conditions can sometimes prevent colonization by native biota in otherwise similar artificial habitats.We suggest that a search for hab- itat analogues represents an important principle to guide reconciliation ecology in urban and indus- trial lands. In constrast, analogous ecosystems may also support pest species that exploit the similarities between anthropogenic habitats and their ancestral habitats. 4. Synthesis and applications. Identifying analogous habitats and ecosystems could enhance biodi- versity conservation and ecosystem services in anthropogenic environments. Abiotic and biotic differences between artificial analogues and natural systems can be frequently overcome by ecologi- cal engineering to make the environment more suitable for native biodiversity, and⁄or assisted dispersal to allow suitable native organisms to reach appropriate sites within artificial ecosystems. Altering some habitats to become less analogous may help reduce impacts of pest species in urban and industrial areas. Key-words:},

abstract = {Plant selection for extensive green roofs has largely been based on cool, temperate climate research. However, as green roof implementation in hotter and drier climates increases, there is a need to evaluate plant performance under these climatic conditions. Succulents have been shown to be successful in hot and dry green roofs, although survival differs between species and the role of leaf succulence in survival has not been fully explored. For non-succulent plants, habitats with conditions similar to green roofs ('habitat templates') have been used to select plants, although few studies have discussed the performance of these selections under green roof conditions. Therefore, we evaluated establishment of 32 plant species on an unirrigated extensive (125 mm deep) green roof in Melbourne, Australia over a 42 week period (from winter through summer into autumn). Plants were selected on the basis of life-form, succulence, appropriate habitat templates and/or successful use on green roofs internationally. Climatic conditions during the experiment were often extreme, with evaporation regularly exceeding rainfall and a hot and dry summer (mean maximum air temperature 35 °C and 80.6 mm total rainfall), leading to roof temperatures of 65 °C. After 42 weeks, only succulent plants remained alive and only three of the succulent species had 100{\%} survival. Survival was positively related to the degree of leaf succulence (g H2O leaf area cm-1) making this a useful trait for plant selection for unirrigated green roofs in hot, dry climates. The failure of most species, despite being chosen from appropriate habitats, demonstrates the need to evaluate potential plants on green roofs under extreme climatic conditions. Supplementary irrigation may be essential to sustain non-succulent species during extreme weather in hot and dry climates.},

Over five years, 5,200 bees were collected in grassland plots with different levels of urbanization. Most of the difference in species composition among three levels of urbanization was due to rare species that may not have been discovered in all plots. Neither the number of species nor their abundance differed significantly among the plot types, although the trend indicated increasing diversity with increasing distance from urbanization. Most notably, measures of urbanization, such as the amount of pavement and development, were not correlated with diversity. The most important factor affecting bee abundance, particularly for ground-nesting bees, was grazing regime. Bee abundance also was positively related to the number of flowering plant species. Other studies of different insects (grasshoppers and butterflies) in these plots showed results similar to ours. In contrast, previous studies on song-birds, raptors, and rodents showed significant differences between urban edge and remote plots in terms of organism abundance and diversity. Together, these results suggest that factors otherthan the degree of urbanization are important in determining insect abundance and diversity.},

abstract = {Domestic gardens provide a significant component of urban green infrastructure but their relative contribution to eco-system service provision remains largely un-quantified. 'Green infrastructure' itself is often ill-defined, posing problems for planners to ascertain what types of green infrastructure provide greatest benefit and under what circumstances. Within this context the relative merits of gardens are unclear; however, at a time of greater urbanization where private gardens are increasingly seen as a 'luxury', it is important to define their role precisely. Hence, the nature of this review is to interpret existing information pertaining to gardens/gardening . per se, identify where they may have a unique role to play and to highlight where further research is warranted. The review suggests that there are significant differences in both form and management of domestic gardens which radically influence the benefits. Nevertheless, gardens can play a strong role in improving the environmental impact of the domestic curtilage, e.g. by insulating houses against temperature extremes they can reduce domestic energy use. Gardens also improve localized air cooling, help mitigate flooding and provide a haven for wildlife. Less favourable aspects include contributions of gardens and gardening to greenhouse gas emissions, misuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and introduction of alien plant species. Due to the close proximity to the home and hence accessibility for many, possibly the greatest benefit of the domestic garden is on human health and well-being, but further work is required to define this clearly within the wider context of green infrastructure. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bees are the primary pollinators of angiosperms throughout the world. There are more than 16,000 described species, with broad variation in life history traits such as nesting habitat, diet, and social behavior. Despite their importance as pollinators, the evolution of bee biodiversity is understudied: relationships among the seven families of bees remain controversial, and no empirical global-level reconstruction of historical biogeography has been attempted. Morphological studies have generally suggested that the phylogeny of bees is rooted near the family Colletidae, whereas many molecular studies have suggested a root node near (or within) Melittidae. Previous molecular studies have focused on a relatively small sample of taxa ({\~{}}150 species) and genes (seven at most). Public databases contain an enormous amount of DNA sequence data that has not been comprehensively analysed in the context of bee evolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We downloaded, aligned, concatenated, and analysed all available protein-coding nuclear gene DNA sequence data in GenBank as of October, 2011. Our matrix consists of 20 genes, with over 17,000 aligned nucleotide sites, for over 1,300 bee and apoid wasp species, representing over two-thirds of bee genera. Whereas the matrix is large in terms of number of genes and taxa, there is a significant amount of missing data: only {\~{}}15{\%} of the matrix is populated with data. The placement of the root as well as relationships between Andrenidae and other bee families remain ambiguous, as several alternative maximum-likelihood estimates fall within the statistically credible set. However, we recover strong bootstrap support for relationships among many families and for their monophyly. Ancestral geographic range reconstruction suggests a likely origin of bees in the southern hemisphere, with Melittidae ancestrally located within Africa, and Halictidae, Colletidae, and Apidae within the New World.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study affirms the monophyly of each bee family, sister-taxa relationships between Apidae and Megachilidae (the 'long-tongued bees'), between Colletidae and Stenotritidae, and between Colletidae + Stenotritidae and Halictidae. Our analyses reject a Colletidae-basal hypothesis for family-level relationships and instead support Melittidae as sister to the remaining bees. Southern hemisphere vicariance likely played an important role in early diversification within many bee families.},

abstract = {1.Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2.Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3.We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's $\lambda$ performed well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's $\lambda$ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4.Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5.We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6.These guidelines aim to better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades.},

However, the relationship between community structure and ecosystem functioning in natural systems is poorly understood. Here we show that habitat loss appeared to disrupt ecosystem functioning by affecting extinction order, species richness and abundance. We studied pollination by bees in a mosaic of agricultural and natural habitats in California and dung burial by dung beetles on recently created islands in Venezuela. We found that large-bodied bee and beetle species tended to be both most extinction-prone and most functionally efficient, contributing to rapid functional loss. Simulations confirmed that extinction order led to greater disruption of function than predicted by random species loss. Total abundance declined with richness and also appeared to contribute to loss of function. We demonstrate conceptually and empirically how the non-random response of communities to disturbance can have unexpectedly large functional consequences.},

Pre-construction censusing indicated that no endangered or threatened species nested within the project site, and that use of the site by migratory waterfowl was minimal. Post-construction censuses revealed that wetland construction resulted in the arrival of two state endangered species, Least Bittern and Yellow-headed Blackbird, which nested on site, and in three state endangered species, Pied-billed Grebe, Great Egret, and Black-crowned Night-Heron, which visited the site during the breeding season.

However, treatment wetland technol- ogies have not been used extensively in the tropics. To advance tropical studies, a pilot-scale SSFW was constructed on the campus of the University of the Atlantic in Barranquilla, Colombia. The systems performance was monitored from January to July of 2009. The treatment system consisted of a 760-L septic tank followed by three mesocsom-scale subsurface-flow constructed wetlands in parallel arrangement. Clarified wastewater was batch loaded to each unit at a rate of 53 L/m2/day to affect a hydraulic retention time of approximately 3 days. One of the treatment units served as a non-planted control (gravel only), while the other two treatment units were planted with either Eriochloa aristata or Eleocharis mutata. The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of the treatment units (planted vs. unplanted), with respect to their abilities to augment treatment of septic tank effluent (sanitary wastewater).

abstract = {Plant species richness influences methane emission from constructed wetlands (CWs), but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we determined the rate of methane oxidation and flux, the abundance of methanogen 16S rRNA gene and methanotroph pmoA gene (encoding the $\alpha$-subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase), and the microbial diversity of methanogens and methanotrophs in the CW microcosm. The microcosms cultivated with a plant species richness level of 1 (monoculture) and 4 (mixture) species were fed with simulated wastewater with a high nitrogen concentration (336mgL-1). The results revealed a methane emission ranging from 0.101 to 0.476mg CH4m-2h-1in different systems; the planted systems achieved a higher methane flux rate than the unplanted systems. The highest CH4flux was detected in the mixture system. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the methanogen and methanotroph diversity revealed a relative stability of the microbial community structures, but the populations varied. Pearson analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between methanogenic and methanotrophic populations and potential methane oxidation activity and CH4flux, respectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the plant biomass exerted an important influence on both methanogenic and methanotrophic communities. The environmental conditions in the mixture systems supported a relatively higher abundance of methanogens and lowest abundance of methanotrophs, which might provide an explanation for the higher CH4emissions. Rumex japonicus performed better than other plant species in mediating nitrogen removal. The CH4flux of the monoculture system with Rumex japonicus did not differ from that of the mixture system. Thus, we hypothesize that Rumex japonicus may play an important role in mixed CWs, and its function in the mixture system necessitates further investigation.},

abstract = {Single-stage constructed wetlands (CWs) are characterized by a low potential for N removal. Understanding the pathways regulating N cycling as well as their dependence on environmental variables might improve the potential of CWs for N removal and results in more accurate simulation tools. In this study we employed qPCR targeting marker functional genes (amoA, nirK, nirS, clade I and II nosZ) or microorganisms (anammox) regulating key pathways of N cycling to unravel their relative importance. Furthermore, the influence of plant species on treatment performance was studied. Our findings indicated nitrification-denitrification as the principal route of N removal in CWs, while anammox did not have a strong contribution. Evidence was also arisen that ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) contributed on NH3oxidation. Overall, plant species had a weak effect on the abundance of N functional genes (amoA of AOA), but it strongly affected the performance of CWs in terms of N removal in the following order: unplanted {\textless} Phragmites communis {\textless} Typha latifolia. These findings suggest that plant species stimulate N removal by upregulating the rates that the responsible biochemical pathways operate, probably by increasing O2supply. In addition, our study revealed differences in indicators linked to N2O emissions. The abundance of clade II nosZ genes remained low across the season scaling down a strong contribution in the reduction of the emitted N2O. The increasing ratios of nosZ/$\sigma$nir and nirS/nirK with the progress of season indicate a shift in the composition of denitrifiers towards strains with a lower genetic potential for N2O release. Similar trends were observed among the treatments but the mechanisms differed. The planted treatments stimulated an increase in the $\sigma$nosZ/$\sigma$nir ratio, while the unplanted an increase in the nirS/nirK ratio.},

Combining a complete avian phylogeny with surveys along urbanisation gradients from five continents, we show that highly urbanised environments supported on average 450 million fewer years of evolutionary history than the surrounding natural environments. This loss was primarily caused by species loss and could have been higher had not been partially compensated by the addition of urban exploiters and some exotic species. Highly urbanised environments also supported fewer evolutionary distinctive species, implying a disproportionate loss of evolutionary history. Compared with highly urbanised environments, changes in phylogenetic richness and evolutionary distinctiveness were less substantial in moderately urbanised environments. Protecting pristine environments is therefore essential for maintaining phylogenetic diversity, but moderate levels of urbanisation still preserve much of the original diversity.},

abstract = {While the positive role of macrophytes on removal efficiency in constructed wetlands has been well established, possible differences in performance between plants species of comparable life forms and sizes are much harder to demonstrate. We reviewed 35 experimental studies published in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings on the effect of macrophyte species selection on pollutant removal in SSFCW. The studies cover a wide range of macrophyte species, experimental approaches (from well-replicated microcosm experiments to comparison between full full-size constructed wetlands), climatic conditions (from tropical to cold-temperate) and types of effluent (domestic, industrial, etc.). Frequent methodological limitations in these studies compel caution in the interpretation of their results. Yet, the fact that the majority found some (occasionally large) differences in efficiency between plant species for one or more type of pollutant suggests that macrophyte species selection does matter. However, there is little generalization to be made that could help guide species selection for SSFCW, except for the exact conditions in which the experiments were done. For example, the same pair of species that was tested in different studies occasionally gave opposite results in terms of which one performs best. Also, most studies provided few insights on the mechanisms or plant properties that could explain the observed differences in plant species efficiency. Finally, we discuss other relevant research questions and approaches that could help better guide macrophyte species selection for CW. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Habitat loss from urban development threatens native plant populations in many regions of the world. In addition to direct plant mortality, urban intensification potentially impacts pollinator communities and in turn disrupts the pollination mutualisms that are critical to the viability of native plant populations. We placed standardized flowering plant arrays into woodlands along a gradient of increasing urban land use to simultaneously quantify landscape-scale and local-scale effects on pollinators and on reproduction of two spring ephemeral wildflowers (Claytonia virginica and Polemonium reptans) in woodland fragments in the Mid-Atlantic Region of North America. Greater pollinator abundance and associated diversity significantly reduced the degree of pollen limitation, demonstrating that pollinator populations are critical to successful pollination of these plant populations. However, landscape-scale habitat loss did not reduce pollinator abundance or diversity. Habitat loss at the landscape scale therefore does not appear to drive changes in pollination in this woodland system. Rather, local-scale habitat characteristics were more important, with pollinators being more abundant in brighter woodland patches for one plant species, and in larger patches for the other species. Because we found abundant pollinators and adequate pollination even in isolated, urban woodland fragments, our results are encouraging for the conservation of both plants and pollinators in urban landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Mixed-culture groups improved the removal efficiency of TN and TP significantly but exhibited lower COD removal rates. Total plant biomasses were improved as the species richness increased, but the N/P content in the plants was mainly affected by the type of species. The mixed-culture groups showed lower photosynthesis rates and oxygen supply generated from roots under high irradiation. Microbial communities of the cultured groups in the rhizosphere exhibited significant differences. According to principal component analysis (PCA), the fungi were the typical microbes of SPA, SPAB, and SPABC, resulted in improvement in nutrient accumulation. These results demonstrated that a mixed culture strategy can represent the overyielding of biomass, promote the photo-protection mechanism, and will further increase the removal rates of pollutants in a constructed wetland.},

abstract = {Urban gardens may support bees by providing resources in otherwise resource-poor environments. However, it is unclear whether urban, backyard gardens with native plants will support more bees than gardens without native plants. We examined backyard gardens in northwestern Ohio to ask: 1) Does bee diversity, abundance, and community composition differ in backyard gardens with and without native plants? 2)What characteristics of backyard gardens and land cover in the surrounding landscape correlate with changes in the bee community? 3) Do bees in backyard gardens respond more strongly to local or landscape factors? We sampled bees with pan trapping, netting, and direct observation. We examined vegetation characteristics and land cover in 500 m, 1 km, and 2 km buffers surrounding each garden. Abundance of all bees, native bees, and cavity-nesting bees (but not ground-nesting bees) was greater in native plant gardens but only richness of cavity-nesting bees differed in gardens with and without native plants. Bee community composition differed in gardens with and without native plants. Overall, bee richness and abundance were positively correlated with local characteristics of backyard gardens, such as increased floral abundance, taller vegetation, more cover by woody plants, less cover by grass, and larger vegetable gardens. Differences in the amount of forest, open space, and wetlands surrounding gardens influenced abundance of cavity- and ground-nesting bees, but at different spatial scales. Thus, presence of native plants, and local and landscape characteristics might play important roles in maintaining bee diversity within urban areas. Keywords},

We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emer- gent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, charac- ter reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these ar- eas.

abstract = {Since its introduction in 2001, MrBayes has grown in popularity as a software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. With this note, we announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the latest official release presented in 2003. The new version provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems. The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard, negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms. Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be estimated accurately across the entire model space using the stepping stone method. The new version provides more output options than previously, including samples of ancestral states, site rates, site d(N)/d(S) rations, branch rates, and node dates. A wide range of statistics on tree parameters can also be output for visualization in FigTree and compatible software.},

I present a simple ecosystem model in which primary producers (plants) and decomposers (microbes) are linked through material cycling. The model considers a diversity of plant organic compounds and a diversity of microbial species. Nutrient recycling efficiency from organic compounds to decomposers is then the key parameter that controls ecosystem processes (primary productivity, secondary productivity, producer biomass and decomposer biomass). The model predicts that microbial diversity has a positive effect on nutrient recycling efficiency and ecosystem processes through either greater intensity of microbial exploitation of organic compounds or functional niche complementarity, much like in plants. Microbial niche breadth and overlap should not affect ecosystem processes unless they increase the number of organic compounds that are decomposed. In contrast, the model predicts that plant organic compound diversity can only have a negative effect or, at best, no effect on ecosystem processes, at least in a constant environment. This creates a tension between the effects of plant diversity and microbial diversity on ecosystem functioning, which may explain some recent experimental results.},

abstract = {Constructed wetlands (CW) are considered a successful tool to treat wastewater in many countries: their success is mainly assessed observing the rate of pollution reduction, but CW can also contribute to the conservation of ecosystem services. Among the many ecosystem services provided, the biodiversity of CW has received less attention. The EcoSistema Filtro (ESF) of the Molentargius-Saline Regional Natural Park is a constructed wetland situated in Sardinia (Italy), built to filter treated wastewater, increase habitat diversity, and enhance local biodiversity. A floristic survey has been carried out yearly 1 year after the construction of the artificial ecosystem in 2004, observing the modification of the vascular flora composition in time. The flora of the ESF accounted for 54 {\%} of the whole Regional Park's flora; alien species amount to 12 {\%}; taxa of conservation concern are 6 {\%}. Comparing the data in the years, except for the biennium 2006/2007, we observed a continuous increase of species richness, together with an increase of endemics, species of conservation concern, and alien species too. Once the endemics appeared, they remained part of the flora, showing a good persistence in the artificial wetland. Included in a natural park, but trapped in a sprawling and fast growing urban context, this artificial ecosystem provides multiple uses, by preserving and enhancing biodiversity. This is particularly relevant considering that biodiversity can act as a driver of sustainable development in urban areas where most of the world's population lives and comes into direct contact with nature.},

abstract = {The use of phylogenies in ecology is increasingly common and has broadened our understanding of biological diversity. Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify 'anchor' representatives: for $\alpha$-diversity metrics these are PD (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.},

Functional traits are receiving increasing attention as the main ecological attributes by which different organisms and biological communities influence ecosystem services through their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here we synthesize concepts and empirical evidence on linkages between functional traits and ecosystem services across different trophic levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed considered plants and soil invertebrates, but quantitative trait–service associations have been documented for a range of organisms and ecosystems, illustrating the wide applicability of the trait approach. Within each trophic level, specific processes are affected by a combination of traits while particular key traits are simultaneously involved in the control of multiple processes. These multiple associations between traits and ecosystem processes can help to identify predictable trait–service clusters that depend on several trophic levels, such as clusters of traits of plants and soil organisms that underlie nutrient cycling, herbivory, and fodder and fibre production. We propose that the assessment of trait–service clusters will represent a crucial step in ecosystem service monitoring and in balancing the delivery of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, services in ecosystem management.},

While this population growth is significant in its magnitude, the ecological footprint of natural resource consumption and use required to sustain urban populations is even greater. The land use and cover changes accompanying urbanization (increasing human habitation coupled with resource consumption and extensive landscape modification) impacts natural ecosystems at multiple spatial scales. Because they generally occupy lower landscape positions and are linked to other ecosystems through hydrologic connec-tions, the cascading effects of habitat alteration on watershed hydrology and nutrient cycling are particularly detrimental to wetland ecosystems. I reviewed literature relevant to these effects of urbanization on the structure and function of forested wetlands. Hydrologic changes caused by habitat fragmentation generally reduce species richness and abundance of plants, macroinvertebrates, amphibians, and birds with greater numbers of invasives and exotics. Reduction in soil saturation and lowered water tables result in greater nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in urban wetlands with higher probability of NO − 3 export from the watershed. Depressional forested wetlands in urban areas can function as important sinks for sediments, nutrients, and metals. As urban ecosystems become the predominant human condition, there is a critical need for data specific to urban forested wetlands in order to better understand the role of these ecosystems on the landscape.},

Wastewaters were from a dairy farm, a dairy processing plant, a banana paper plant, and a landfill. Four of the five wetland systems were effective in reducing nutrient levels of effluents before water was discharged into rivers. Ammonia levels in water entering most wetlands were considerably higher than ambient (i.e., riverine) levels; concentrations were reduced by as much as 92{\%} in the wetlands and retained at a maximum rate of 166 g N m-2year-1. Nitrate nitrogen removal was variable, but occurred in low concentrations in the inflows (less than 1 mg N L-1). Phosphate phosphorus was present in high levels but was effectively reduced through the wetlands (92 and 45{\%} reductions through dairy farm wetlands, 83{\%} reduction through banana paper wetlands, and 80{\%} reduction through dairy processing wetlands). Retention of phosphate phosphorus ranged from 0.1 to 10.7 g P m-2year-1in the treatment wetlands. Dissolved oxygen in the wetland outflows were ≤2 mg L-1in three of the sampled wetlands, most likely a result of the abundant free-floating macrophytes that sheltered the water from diffusion and shaded aquatic productivity. The efficacy of these created wetlands to treat effluents from different sources varied, and modified wetland designs or active management may be necessary to improve water quality even further. Recommendations on tropical wetland design and management are presented, as are suggestions for implementing this ecological engineering approach with farmers in Central America. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

annote = {BACKGROUND
- tested green roof monoculture and mixtures on stormwater retention based on water-use strategies
- Based in Australia (warm dry ecosystem)
- to optimize rainfall retention + plant survival, plants needs to have high transpiration after rainfall + survive dry period 
- biodiversity may improve retention through: (1) transgressive overyielding, (2) selection effect
- but, life-form diversity is likely complicated by differences in biomass and rainfall interceptions
- grass monocultures have higher retention than some life-form mixtures
- possibility: unmeasured traits may affect retention, used plants with different water-use strategies (plastic, conservative)
- hypothesis: (1) monocultures with water-use plasticity should have higher retention than succulents (conservative), (2) mixtures would have higher rainfall retention due to complementarity in aboveground biomass

METHODS 
- greenhouse experiment
- six treatments
(1) bare substrate
(2) monocultures of each spcies
(3) mixtures
- rainfall stimulation from Jul-Oct based on a prior climatic rainfall dataset
- measuresements:
(1) retention + runoff
(2) evaporation
(3) soil water content 
(4) aboveground biomass
(5) belowground biomass 

FINDINGS:
- Green roofs captured 73{\%} of rainfall
- Retention was not always higher in mixtures than monocultures --{\textgreater} affected by watering regime --{\textgreater} water-use strategies
- Certain sedum species have poor ability to retain water --{\textgreater} root systems create preferential flow pathways through substrate
- the presence of Sedum in mixtures created a selection effect (prob higher cover) and reduced performance.

abstract = {Four wetland plant species (Scirpus validus, Carex lacustris, Phalaris arundinacea, and Typha latifolia) were grown in monoculture and as a four-species mixture to compare effectiveness of nutrient removal in controlled 18.93-l outdoor subsurface treatment wetland microcosms. A nutrient treatment that mimicked single-resident domestic effluent consisted of two levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [low (56 mg/l N and 31 mg/l P) and high (112 mg/l N and 62 mg/l P)] of nutrient solution applied three times weekly. The plants were established and maintained for one year before the nutrient treatment and monthly water sampling commenced; water sampling began July 31, 2001 and ended October 23, 2001. We tested four hypotheses: (1) vegetated microcosms are more effective at reducing concentrations of total N and total P from soil leachate than unvegetated, (2) there is a differential species effect on the potential to reduce N and P, (3) plant mixtures are more effective than monocultures at reducing N and P, and (4) the microcosms will be least effective at reducing N and P concentrations in October compared to August. We found support for hypotheses 1, 2, and 4, but our results are inconclusive for the third hypothesis. Total N and total P in the soil leachate were significantly higher from unvegetated microcosms compared to vegetated. S. validus was most effective and P. arundinacea was generally least effective at reducing N and P in monocultures, with treatment capabilities similar to unvegetated microcosms. The four-species mixture was generally highly effective at nutrient removal, however the results were not significantly different from the monocultures. At the end of the growing season (October) treatment efficiency was significantly less than earlier months, especially for the unvegetated treatment. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To preserve populations of endangered bee species, sound knowledge of their maximum foraging distance between nest and host plants is crucial. Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200 m for small bee species and up to 1100 m for very large species based on mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus, were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants. Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands. The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus punctulatissimus was 1100 m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi 1275 m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400 m, indicating that maximum foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However, the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied only to a small percentage of individuals as 50{\%} of the females of H. punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than 100-225 m and 300 m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species specific maximum foraging distances. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The study site is a retention pond located in northeast Nantes (France) that receives the storm water runoff from a section of highway (27,000 vehicles/day, basin surface 375m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). Three floating marshes were anchored in the retention pond, each raft with a surface area of 1.5m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} (125cm×120cm) supporting 16 plants (8 Juncus, 8 Carex). After 4 months, plant samples were harvested, mineralized and analyzed by atomic spectrometry absorption to determine cadmium, nickel and zinc concentrations. Analysis showed Ni concentration in leaves between 23 and 31$\mu$g/g{\textless}inf{\textgreater}drymatter{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, and between 113 and 131$\mu$g/g in roots. Accumulation of Zn was 45-80$\mu$g/g in leaves and 168-210$\mu$g/g in roots. The root/leaf ratio, between 2.6 and 5.7 for Ni and Zn respectively, highlights the important function of roots in heavy metal accumulation. No cadmium accumulation was detected in plants. All three metals were also present in the biofilm on roots. Moreover, roots demonstrated a capacity to filter particulates. This study shows that floating marshes can effectively remove some metals from stormwater ponds.},

abstract = {The diversity of life is ultimately generated by evolution, and much attention has focused on the rapid evolution of ecological traits. Yet, the tendency for many ecological traits to instead remain similar over time [niche conservatism (NC)] has many consequences for the fundamental patterns and processes studied in ecology and conservation biology. Here, we describe the mounting evidence for the importance of NC to major topics in ecology (e.g. species richness, ecosystem function) and conservation (e.g. climate change, invasive species). We also review other areas where it may be important but has generally been overlooked, in both ecology (e.g. food webs, disease ecology, mutualistic interactions) and conservation (e.g. habitat modification). We summarize methods for testing for NC, and suggest that a commonly used and advocated method (involving a test for phylogenetic signal) is potentially problematic, and describe alternative approaches. We suggest that considering NC: (1) focuses attention on the within-species processes that cause traits to be conserved over time, (2) emphasizes connections between questions and research areas that are not obviously related (e.g. invasives, global warming, tropical richness), and (3) suggests new areas for research (e.g. why are some clades largely nocturnal? why do related species share diseases?).},

abstract = {Both the presence and diversity of plants are integral to the development and functional abilities of microbial communities within constructed wetlands (CWs). The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of different individual and paired plant species combinations on microbial community function in HSSF mesocosm CWs. Experimental systems were quadruplicated and operated as two mesocosms in series planted with Phragmites australis (X) or Phalaris arundinacea (O), giving four possible sequential combinations (XX, XO, OX, OO). Wastewater was loaded each day into position 1 mesocosm with the outflow entering position 2 mesocosm, and the corresponding position 2 mesocosm outflow representing an overall experimental system effluent. The metabolic function of the interstitial-based microbial communities within each of the 16 mesocosm pairs was assessed at a single time point in the spring (May) based on community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) gathered using Biolog{\textregistered}EcoPlates. Microbial activity and metabolic richness (number of carbon sources utilised) were found to be higher in position 1 mesocosms compared to position two. Microbial community carbon source utilisation patterns (CSUPs), overall activity and metabolic richness were similar between all mesocosms from position 1-irrespective of plant species. When assessing microbial communities in position 2 of each pairing a greater variety of CSUPs, activities and metabolic richness' could be found suggesting the sequence and choice of plant can alter the microbial community function in the HSSF mesocosms. Of particular interest were the mesocosm/plant species combinations containing Phalaris in the position 2 which led to higher overall microbial activity and richness, distinct carbon source utilisation patterns (CSUPs) and an increased utilisation of specific carbon sources further from the inlet. More specifically the XO pairings (Phragmites-Phalaris) seemed to offer the most promising overall microbial function throughout both positions 1 and 2 in series suggesting plant diversity may help enhance microbial community function, and therefore microbial based water treatment capacity. The findings also suggest that the microbial communities associated with each plant species respond differently to factors such as nutrient availability, and although not yet clearly defined, further highlights the potential for improved or tailored water treatment in CWs through selection of specific plant species and combinations. Broader microbial community function or greater activity did not correlate with improved water treatment efficiency in this study. This may have been due to the relatively low contaminant loads utilised, or the limited amount of data collected. Further study across several seasons or with higher contaminant loads is recommended.},

abstract = {Amount of semi-natural habitats (permanent grasslands, woodlands and hedgerows) and their level of fragmentation are among the main determinants of wild bee diversity in agricultural landscapes. However, their impact on the distribution of bee ecological traits has received little attention. In this study, we aimed to explore whether changes in the distribution of bee ecological traits along gradients of habitat amount and fragmentation were due to a direct effect of landscape context on multiple traits ('response traits') or to a correlation of response traits with other ecological traits not involved in the response of bee species to landscape context. In two study regions in southwest France and southeast Australia, we used a RLQ analysis (three-table ordination method) to link bee traits with habitat amount and fragment isolation measured at the landscape scale. We found that bee ecological traits shifted at the community-level in association with landscape gradients, whereas species-level associations among bee traits and phylogenetic clustering in bee communities were of only minor importance in determining such shifts. We found that traits such as body size and nest location were closely linked to habitat amount and fragmentation. We also observed regionally-specific relationships among ecological traits, suggesting that the regional species pool can play an important role in determining the response of bee communities to habitat amount and fragmentation. Our findings suggest that improved knowledge about how trait-based responses mediate the impact of landscapes on wild bee communities will allow better prediction and understanding of subsequent effects on ecosystem functioning.},

Agricultural intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss and has multiple components operating at different spatial scales: from in-field management intensity to landscape-scale simplification. Here we show that landscape-level effects dominate functional community composition and can even buffer the effects of in-field management intensification on functional homogenization, and that animal communities in real-world managed landscapes show a unified response (across orders and guilds) to both landscape-scale simplification and in-field intensification. Adults and larvae with specialized feeding habits, species with shorter activity periods and relatively small body sizes are selected against in simplified landscapes with intense in-field management. Our results demonstrate that the diversity of land cover types at the landscape scale is critical for maintaining communities, which are functionally diverse, even in landscapes where in-field management intensity is high.},

abstract = {In this study, we aim to gain a better insight on how habitat filtering due to urbanization shapes bird communities of Vienna city parks. This may help to derive implications for urban planning in order to promote and maintain high diversity and ecosystem function in an increasing urbanized environment. The structure of wintering bird communities of 36 Vienna city parks – surveyed once a month in January 2009, December 2009, December 2012, and January 2013 – was described by species richness and the functional diversity measurements FRic (functional richness), FEve (functional evenness), and FDiv (functional divergence). Environmental filtering was quantified by park size, canopy heterogeneity within the park, and the proportion of sealed area surrounding each park. Species richness, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing park size. Sealed area had a strong negative effect on species richness and FDiv. Canopy heterogeneity played a minor role in explaining variance in FDiv data. FEve did not respond to any of these park parameters. Our results suggest a loss of species richness and functional diversity, hence most likely indicate a decline in ecosystem function, with decreasing park size and increasing sealed area of the surrounding urban landscape matrix.},

abstract = {This paper presents, for the first time, evidence to show that Calluna species are one causative factor of piping in blanket peat catchments. Ground-penetrating radar survey on 960 plots illustrated that piping was prevalent throughout blanket peats. However, soil pipe occurrence was significantly higher where bare peat (149 pipes/ km) or Calluna (87 pipes/ km) were present compared to other species (67 pipes/ km). A case study catchment where there was an altitudinal limit to Calluna provided some control over potential factors that may lead to an association between piping and Calluna. Under the controlled conditions of topographic index, peat depth, and water table, piping was greater under the Calluna-covered peat than under other vegetation covers. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that 10 years worth of rainfall was enough to almost double the proportion of macropore flow occurring in recently colonized Calluna peatlands. This suggests that given enough water and time, the woody Calluna plants result in water being preferentially channeled through the upper peat. Improvements are therefore required in our understanding of the relationships between peatland plant nutrient and water supply and the feedbacks between ecosystem functioning and landform development. These results are also important given the propensity to encourage Calluna growth for game bird enhancement in many northern peatlands.},

abstract = {Urbanisation is considered an important driver of current biodiversity loss, but the underlying causes are not fully understood. It is generally assumed that this loss reflects the fact that most organisms do not tolerate well the environmental alterations associated with urbanisation. Nevertheless, current evidence is inconclusive and the alternative that the biodiversity loss is the result of random mechanisms has never been evaluated. Analysing changes in abundance between urbanised environments and their non-urbanised surroundings of {\textgreater} 800 avian species from five continents, we show here that although random processes account for part of the species loss associated with urbanisation, much of the loss is associated with a lack of appropriate adaptations of most species for exploiting resources and avoiding risks of the urban environments. These findings have important conservation implications because the extinction of species with particular features should have higher impact on biodiversity and ecosystem function than a random loss.},

abstract = {The Mantel test provides a means to test the association between distance matrices and has been widely used in ecological and evolutionary studies. Re- cently, another permutation test based on a Procrustes statistic (PROTEST) was developed to compare multi- variate data sets. Our study contrasts the effectiveness, in terms of power and type I error rates, of the Mantel test and PROTEST. We illustrate the application of Procrus- tes superimposition to visually examine the concordance of observations for each dimension separately and how to conduct hypothesis testing in which the association between two data sets is tested while controlling for the variation related to other sources of data. Our simulation results show that PROTEST is as powerful or more powerful than the Mantel test for detecting matrix asso- ciation under a variety of possible scenarios. As a result of the increased power of PROTEST and the ability to assess the match for individual observations (not avail- able with the Mantel test), biologists now have an addi- tional and powerful analytical tool to study ecological and evolutionary relationships.},

abstract = {Wetlands provide critical habitat for a diverse group of organisms and provide important ecosystem services. Despite this, most natural wetlands have been lost to anthropogenic activities, and as a result, wetland construction is common mitigation practice. Therefore, examination of constructed wetland viability in replacing the function of lost wetlands is vital. Our primary objectives were to compare amphibian communities of shallow and deep constructed wetlands to natural wetlands and to identify which wetland characteristics affect species composition. All wetlands were hydrologically isolated and fishless; natural wetlands had an ephemeral hydrology, and constructed wetland hydrology varied from ephemeral to permanent. Overall, constructed wetlands did not sufficiently replicate natural wetlands with respect to the amphibian community. However, two of our constructed wetlands had a drying period and exhibited communities more similar to natural wetlands. Hydroperiod and canopy closure were indicators of amphibian community composition. Many species observed in natural wetlands were rare in shallow constructed and absent in deep constructed wetlands. Additionally, dominant predator species (primarily Lithobates catesbeianus, Lithobates clamitans, and Notophthalmus viridescens) associated with permanent water were more abundant in constructed wetlands. Water depth, pH, and emergent vegetation were lower in natural wetlands. These data influenced land managers to revise construction methods and to renovate deep constructed wetlands by creating gradual slopes, decreasing maximum depth to 20 cm or less, maintaining canopy cover, and decreasing soil compaction to attempt replication of natural wetland hydrology.},

Little is known about the mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries, community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were collected using pan traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over the active season in 2012 and 2013. A total of 32,237 specimens were identified, representing 200 species and 6 families, including two new continental records, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Hylaeus communis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} Nylander (1852) and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Anthidium florentinum{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (Fabricius, 1775). Despite high community evenness, we found significant abundance of diverse species, including exotic ones. Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this paper we evaluated the process of Phragmites encroachment into Phalaris stands in two constructed wetlands with horizontal subsurface flow. The results revealed that 50{\%} of the area originally planted with Phalaris was overgrown by Phragmites in 5 and 9 years in the monitored systems while the complete elimination of Phalaris occurred after 9 and 13 years. Replacement of Phalaris did not have any effect on removal of BOD5and COD while removal efficiency of TSS increased after Phalaris was replaced with Phragmites.

abstract = {Green roofs in the Mediterranean region are often exposed to high levels of radiation, extreme temperatures, and an inconsistent water supply. To withstand these harsh conditions in shallow soils and poorly aerated growth media, plants must be armored with adaptations. Strategies that have evolved in desert plants can play significant roles in the use of plants for green covers. In the following, we will specifically focus on (1) heat and radiation, (2) drought, and (3) salinity. Further, we will discuss (4) interactions between neighboring plants. Finally, we will (5) propose a design for diverse green roofs that includes horticultural and medicinal products and provides diverse habitats. Many desert plants have developed morphological and anatomical features to avoid photo-inhibition, which can be advantageous for growth on green roofs. Plants exhibiting C4 photosynthesis or crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis have a protected hydraulic system that enables growth under dry conditions. Furthermore, dew and high levels of relative humidity can provide reliable water sources under limited precipitation. Halophytes are protected against salinity, ionic specific stress, and nutritional imbalances, characteristics that can be advantageous for green roofs. Under limited space, competition for resources becomes increasingly relevant. Allelopathy can also induce the germination and growth inhibition of neighboring plants. Many desert plants, as a result of their exposure to environmental stress, have developed unique survival adaptations based on secondary metabolites that can be used as pharmaceuticals. A systematic survey of plant strategies to withstand these extreme conditions provides a basis for increasing the number of green roof candidates. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Background and aims The application of green roof technology has become more common in the central, northwestern and eastern United States, and is now being employed across the southern U.S. as well. However, there is little research evaluating plant survival on unirrigated green roofs in subtropical climates that experience frequent drought and heat stress. Here, we summarize results from a study of plant establishment on a modular green roof in south-central Texas.Methodology Fifteen plant species were field tested in 11.4-cm-deep green roof modules on a four-story building in College Station, Texas with irrigation limited to the first several weeks of establishment. Climate data, plant growth and species survival were measured over three growing seasons.Principal results Four species survived at least two growing seasons without any losses: Graptopetalum paraguayense, Malephora lutea, Manfreda maculosa, and Phemeranthus calycinus. Six species experienced varying levels of mortality: Bulbine frutescens, Delosperma cooperi, Lampranthus spectabilis, Sedum kamtschaticum, Sedum mexicanum and Nassella tenuissima. Five species had no survivors: Dichondra argentea, Stemodia lanata, Myoporum parvifolium, Sedum moranense, and Sedum tetractinum.Conclusions The establishment and survival of several plant species without any mortality suggests that irrigation limited to the first few weeks after planting may be an effective approach on green roofs in spite of the more challenging climatic conditions in the Southern U.S. Since the climate in south-central Texas had been consistently drier and warmer than normal during the study period, longer-term research on these species is recommended to expand knowledge of establishment requirements for these species under a wider range of conditions, including wetter than normal years.},

Many plant species did not germinate at all and the use of cuttings was a better method than direct seeding. The green roof was installed in the spring of 2012 in Chiba city. Thirteen plant species from the Jogasaki sea coast, which were successfully propagated, were planted in three kinds of substrate (15 cm depth): pumice, roof tile and commercial green roof substrate. The water drainage was restricted and a reservoir with 5 cm depth of water underlaid the substrate to simulate a similar growing environment to the sea coast. Volcanic rocks were placed as mulch to create a landscape similar to that on the Jogasaki sea coast. Plant coverage on the green roof was measured every month from June 2012 to October 2014. All plants were harvested and their dry shoot weight was measured in December 2014. The type of substrate did not cause significant differences in plant survival and dry shoot weight. Sea coast plant species were divided into four categories: vigorous growth; seasonal change; disappearing after a few years; limited growth. Understanding the ecology of natural habitats was important to simulating a local landscape using native plant communities on the green roof.},

Our objective was to verify which of these two factors, landscape heterogeneity or functional connectivity, can better explain variations of bee abundance and richness in a fragmented Atlantic Forest region. We sampled flower-visiting bees in 12 landscapes with varying heterogeneity and functional connectivity measured using a Functional Ecological Corridors framework. Both richness and abundance were affected by landscape factors, reaching its highest levels at intermediate levels of functional connectivity in highly heterogeneous landscapes, indicating the existence of strong regime shifts in the system. In low-forested landscapes, conservation actions for pollinating bees should focus on implementing diversified environments with high quality which are interspersed among each other and with native vegetation.},

abstract = {Two studies were conducted with the objective of quantifying the carbon storage potential of extensive green roofs. The first was performed on eight roofs in Michigan and four roofs in Maryland, ranging from 1 to 6 years in age. All 12 green roofs were composed primarily of Sedum species, and substrate depths ranged from 2.5 to 12.7 cm. Aboveground plant material was harvested in the fall of 2006. On average, these roofs stored 162 g C x m(-2) in aboveground biomass. The second study was conducted on a roof in East Lansing, MI. Twenty plots were established on 21 April 2007 with a substrate depth of 6.0 cm. In addition to a substrate only control, the other plots were sown with a single species of Sedum (S. acre, S. album, S. kamtshaticum, or S. spurium). Species and substrate depth represent typical extensive green roofs in the United States. Plant material and substrate were harvested seven times across two growing seasons. Results at the end of the second year showed that aboveground plant material storage varied by species, ranging from 64 g C x m(-2) (S. acre) to 239 g C x m(-2) (S. album), with an average of 168 g C x m(-2). Belowground biomass ranged from 37 g C x m(-2) (S. acre) to 185 g C x m(-2) (S. kamtschaticum) and averaged 107 g C x m(-2). Substrate carbon content averaged 913 g C x m(-2), with no species effect, which represents a sequestration rate of 100 g C x m(-2) over the 2 years of this study. The entire extensive green roof system sequestered 375 g C x m(-2) in above- and belowground biomass and substrate organic matter.},

abstract = {There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many studies have described the effects of urbanization on species richness. These studies indicate that urbanization can increase or decrease species richness, depending on several variables. Some of these variables include: taxonomic group, spatial scale of analysis, and intensity of urbanization. Recent reviews of birds (the most-studied group) indicate that species richness decreases with increasing urbanization in most cases but produces no change or even increases richness in some studies. Here I expand beyond the bird studies by reviewing 105 studies on the effects of urbanization on the species richness of non-avian species: mammals, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates and plants. For all groups, species richness tends to be reduced in areas with extreme urbanization (i.e., central urban core areas). However, the effects of moderate levels of urbanization (i.e., suburban areas) vary significantly among groups. Most of the plant studies (about 65{\%}) indicate increasing species richness with moderate urbanization whereas only a minority of invertebrate studies (about 30{\%}) and a very small minority of non-avian vertebrate studies (about 12{\%}) show increasing species richness. Possible explanations for these results are discussed, including the importance of nonnative species importation, spatial heterogeneity, intermediate disturbance and scale as major factors influencing species richness.},

abstract = {The larger aquatic plants growing in wetlands are usually called macrophytes. These include aquatic vascular plants, aquatic mosses and some larger algae. The presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes is one of the characteristics used to define wetlands, and as such macrophytes are an indispensable component of these ecosystems. As the most important removal processes in constructed treatment wetlands are based on physical and microbial processes, the role of the macrophytes in these has been questioned. This paper summarizes how macrophytes influence the treatment processes in wetlands. The most important functions of the macrophytes in relation to the treatment of wastewater are the physical effects the presence of the plants gives rise to. The macrophytes stabilise the surface of the beds, provide good conditions for physical filtration, prevent vertical flow systems from clogging, insulate the surface against frost during winter, and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth. Contrary to earlier belief, the growth of macrophytes does not increase the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate in soil-based subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The metabolism of the macrophytes affects the treatment processes to different extents depending on the type of the constructed wetland. Plant uptake of nutrients is only of quantitative importance in low-loaded systems (surface flow systems). Macrophyte mediated transfer of oxygen to the rhizosphere by leakage from roots increases aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitrification. The macrophytes have additional site-specific values by providing habitat for wildlife and making wastewater treatment systems aesthetically pleasing. (C) 1997 IAWQ},

abstract = {– A variety of solitary bee species that naturally nest in wood and plant stems aboveground also readily accept nest boxes, which are human-made devices that aggregate these nesting conditions. Nest boxes are sheltered bundles of hollow plant stems, bamboo or reeds, and holes drilled into wood or cavities made of other materials such as glass or polystyrene. In this paper, I examine the best practises in nest box material selection and construction, and the use of nest boxes to address four basic objectives related to our understanding of bee biology and enhancement of pollination services. A variety of materials and cavity dimensions are included in nest boxes that are used to monitor local bee diversity or to address fundamental questions in community ecology and environmental change. Others examine bee biology, physiology and behaviour that use nest boxes to obtain bees for further experimentation. The majority of studies use nest boxes in agricultural landscapes and in alternative pollinator management; these studies improve nest box design for target bee species to augment their numbers. Continued design and data sharing, as well as the refinement of nest box construction and deployment for specific objectives, will ensure they remain useful tools for bee science, conservation and alternative pollinator management.},

abstract = {Novel urban ecosystems have recently gained importance and a consensus grows that ecosystem services are linked to ecosystem properties that in turn can be predicted by functional diversity (FD) of plant communities. Ensuring quality of life in cities is essential and approaches to improve ecosystem services should be encouraged. Here we analyzed the initial plant composition of commercial extensive green roof systems in terms of FD and propose two methods to compose species lists that maximize FD. Clustering techniques grouped the systems in three green roof types that differ in species richness and composition, substrate depth and installation method. Differences in FD and species richness between the types were considerable and correlations between FD and species richness were strongly positive, suggesting that species-rich systems generally have higher FD and thus offer better ecosystem services. Green roof systems that comprise only succulents have significant lower FD values compared to systems containing more diverse vegetation. Within the green roof types there was room for improvement of FD. Based on a species trait dissimilarity matrix, species lists that maximize FD for every green roof type were created. FD analysis of novel ecosystems enables the design of both species-poor and species-rich green roof systems with improved overall ecosystem services value. The described approach is generic in nature and can be used for a broad range of novel ecosystems and urban green elements. We believe that designing functional diverse plant systems will support a more sustainable urban planning and improve the quality of urban life.},

abstract = {Invasive plants are thought to be especially capable of range shifts or expansion in response to climate change due to high dispersal and colonization abilities. Although highly invasive throughout the Intermountain West, the presence and impact of the grass Bromus tectorum has been limited at higher elevations in the eastern Sierra Nevada, potentially due to extreme wintertime conditions. However, climate models project an upward elevational shift of climate regimes in the Sierra Nevada that could favor B. tectorum expansion. This research specifically examined the effects of experimental snow depth manipulations and interannual climate variability over 5 years on B. tectorum populations at high elevation (2,175 m). Experimentally-increased snow depth had an effect on phenology and biomass, but no effect on individual fecundity. Instead an experimentally-increased snowpack inhibited population growth in 1 year by reducing seedling emergence and early survival. A similar negative effect of increased snow was observed 2 years later. However, a strong negative effect on B. tectorum was also associated with a naturally low-snow winter, when seedling emergence was reduced by 86{\%}. Across 5 years, winters with greater snow cover and a slower accumulation of degree-days coincided with higher B. tectorum seedling density and population growth. Thus, we observed negative effects associated with both experimentally-increased and naturally-decreased snowpacks. It is likely that the effect of snow at high elevation is nonlinear and differs from lower elevations where wintertime germination can be favorable. Additionally, we observed a doubling of population size in 1 year, which is alarming at this elevation.},

abstract = {Urban ecology research is changing how we view the biological value and ecological importance of cities. Lagging behind this revised image of the city are natural resource management agencies' urban conservation programs that historically have invested in education and outreach rather than programs designed to achieve high-priority species conservation results. This essay synthesizes research on urban bee species diversity and abundance to suggest how urban conservation can be repositioned to better align with a newly unfolding image of urban landscapes. We argue that pollinators put high-priority and high-impact urban conservation within reach. In a rapidly urbanizing world, transforming how environmental managers view the city can improve citizen engagement while exploring more sustainable practices of urbanization.

The foraging ranges for most bee species are unknown. Foraging distance information is critical for understanding the scale at which bee populations respond to the landscape, assessing the role of bee pollinators in affecting plant population structure, planning conservation strategies for plants, and designing bee habitat refugia that maintain pollination function for wild and crop plants. We used data from 96 records of 62 bee species to determine whether body size predicts foraging distance. We regressed maximum and typical foraging distances on body size and found highly significant and explanatory nonlinear relationships. We used a second data set to: (1) compare observed reports of foraging distance to the distances predicted by our regression equations and (2) assess the biases inherent to the different techniques that have been used to assess foraging distance. The equations we present can be used to predict foraging distances for many bee species, based on a simple measurement of body size.},

abstract = {The positive relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species diversity is a widely accepted concept, generally associated with niche limitation. However, niche limitation cannot account for negative heterogeneity-diversity relationships (HDR) revealed in several case studies. Here we explore how HDR varies at different spatial scales and provide novel theories for small-scale species co-existence that explain both positive and negative HDR. At large spatial scales of heterogeneity (e.g. landscape level), different communities co-exist, promoting large regional species pool size and resulting in positive HDR. At smaller scales within communities, species co-existence can be enhanced by increasing the number of different patches, as predicted by the niche limitation theory, or alternatively, restrained by heterogeneity. We conducted meta-regressions for experimental and observational HDR studies, and found that negative HDRs are significantly more common at smaller spatial scales. We propose three theories to account for niche limitation at small spatial scales. (1) Microfragmentation theory: with increasing spatial heterogeneity, large homogeneous patches lose area and become isolated, which in turn restrains the establishment of new plant individuals and populations, thus reducing species richness. (2) Heterogeneity confounded by mean: when heterogeneity occurs at spatial scales smaller than the size of individual plants, which forage through the patches, species diversity can be either positively or negatively affected by a change in the mean of an environmental factor. (3) Heterogeneity as a separate niche axis: the ability of species to tolerate heterogeneity at spatial scales smaller than plant size varies, affecting HDR. We conclude that processes other than niche limitation can affect the relationship between heterogeneity and diversity.},
