abstract = {Green roofs are often installed to reduce urban stormwater runoff. To optimally achieve this, green roof plants need to use water when available, but reduce transpiration when limited to ensure survival. Succulent species commonly planted on green roofs do not achieve this. Water availability on green roofs is analogous to natural shallow-soil habitats including rock outcrops. We aimed to determine whether granite outcrop species could improve green roof performance by evaluating water use strategies under contrasting water availability.{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}Physiological and morphological responses of 12 granite outcrop species with different life-forms (monocots, herbs and shrubs) and a common green roof succulent were compared in well watered ({\{}WW){\}} and water deficit ({\{}WD){\}} treatments.{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}Granite outcrop species showed a variety of water-use strategies. Unlike the green roof succulent all of the granite outcrop species showed plasticity in water use. Monocot and herb species showed high water use under {\{}WW{\}} but also high water status under {\{}WD.{\}} This was achieved by large reductions in transpiration under {\{}WD.{\}} Maintenance of water status was also related to high root mass fraction.{\{}$\backslash$textbar{\}}By developing a conceptual model using physiological traits we were able to select species suitable for green roofs. The ideal species for green roofs were high water users which were also drought tolerant.},

abstract = {Green infrastructure consists of ecosystems that provide valuable services to urban areas. Constructed ecosystems, including green roofs, bioretention systems, constructed wetlands and bioreactors are artificial, custom-built components of green infrastructure that are becoming more common in cities. Small size, strong spatial boundaries, ecological novelty and the role of human design characterize all constructed ecosystems, influencing their functions and interactions with other urban ecosystems. Here I outline the relevance of ecology and evolution in understanding the functioning of constructed ecosystems. In turn, a research focus on the distinctive aspects of constructed ecosystems can contribute to fundamental science.},

abstract = {Constructed ecosystems such as green roofs often contain monocultures or low-diversity plant communities, but adding more plant species to these systems can increase ecosystem service provisioning. Mixture advantage, when species-rich treatments outperform the best monocultures, is desirable in constructed ecosystems due to the cost of increasing diversity. However, there have not been any studies in constructed ecosystems that have quantitatively compared mixtures with the best monocultures for multifunctionality, and there have been few studies that have examined how provision of ecosystem services changes over time as plant communities develop. In a green roof system, I predicted (i) that the mixture advantage would be stronger for ecosystem multifunctionality than for single ecosystem functions and (ii) that ecosystem service provisioning and complementarity in above-ground biomass would increase over time. Fifteen monocultures of plant species from five life-form groups (succulents, tall forbs, dwarf shrubs, creeping forbs, grasses) were compared with three-species mixtures of the same life-form and mixtures of species from three and five different life-forms in a modular green roof system. Indicators of ecosystem services including above-ground production, thermal regulation, stormwater retention, nutrient uptake and carbon sequestration and two indices of ecosystem multifunctionality were compared. Canopy density increased over time while substrate temperature decreased, suggesting higher provisioning of valuable ecosystem services. For single services, the positive relationship between planted species richness and ecosystem service grew stronger over time, but was consistently strong over time for multifunctionality. Quantile regression indicated a weak mixture advantage for several services including both multifunctionality indices. While the effects were small, different species optimized different functions, thus multifunctioning is enhanced in more diverse mixtures by combining species that maximize different functions. Tripartite partitioning of canopy density showed that overyielding and trait-independent complementarity fluctuated between years in response to shifts in species abundances, but dominance and trait-dependent complementarity increased over time. Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first evidence in a constructed ecosystem that mixtures can outperform the best monocultures for multiple ecosystem services. Mixtures of plant life-forms can improve green roof performance. The biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships observed in natural ecosystems can also occur in novel and highly simplified engineered ecosystems.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Green roofs perform ecosystem services such as summer roof temperature reduction and stormwater capture that directly contribute to lower building energy use and potential economic savings. These services are in turn related to ecosystem functions performed by the vegetation layer such as radiation reflection and transpiration, but little work has examined the role of plant species composition and diversity in improving these functions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a replicated modular extensive (shallow growing- medium) green roof system planted with monocultures or mixtures containing one, three or five life-forms, to quantify two ecosystem services: summer roof cooling and water capture. We also measured the related ecosystem properties/processes of albedo, evapotranspiration, and the mean and temporal variability of aboveground biomass over four months. Mixtures containing three or five life-form groups, simultaneously optimized several green roof ecosystem functions, outperforming monocultures and single life-form groups, but there was much variation in performance depending on which life-forms were present in the three life-form mixtures. Some mixtures outperformed the best monocultures for water capture, evapotranspiration, and an index combining both water capture and temperature reductions. Combinations of tall forbs, grasses and succulents simultaneously optimized a range of ecosystem performance measures, thus the main benefit of including all three groups was not to maximize any single process but to perform a variety of functions well.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ecosystem services from green roofs can be improved by planting certain life-form groups in combination, directly contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. The strong performance by certain mixtures of life-forms, especially tall forbs, grasses and succulents, warrants further investigation into niche complementarity or facilitation as mechanisms governing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in green roof ecosystems.},

abstract = {Plants make important contributions to the services provided by engineered ecosystems such as green roofs. Ecologists use plant species traits as generic predictors of geographical distribution, interactions with other species, and ecosystem functioning, but this approach has been little used to optimize engineered ecosystems. Four plant species traits (height, individual leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) were evaluated as predictors of ecosystem properties and services in a modular green roof system planted with 21 species. Six indicators of ecosystem services, incorporating thermal, hydrological, water quality, and carbon sequestration functions, were predicted by the four plant traits directly or indirectly via their effects on aggregate ecosystem properties, including canopy density and albedo. Species average height and specific leaf area were the most useful traits, predicting several services via effects on canopy density or growth rate. This study demonstrates that easily measured plant traits can be used to select species to optimize green roof performance across multiple key services.},

abstract = {Green roofs are increasingly being used among the suite of tools designed to reduce the volume of surface water runoff generated by cities. Plants provide the primary mechanism for restoring the rainfall retention capacity of green roofs, but selecting plants with high water use is likely to increase drought stress. Using empirically-derived plant physiological parameters, we used a water balance model to assess the trade-off between rainfall retention and plant drought stress under a 30-year climate scenario. We compared high and low water users with either drought avoidance or drought tolerance strategies. Green roofs with low water-using, drought-avoiding species achieved high rainfall retention (66–81{\%}) without experiencing significant drought stress. Roofs planted with other strategies showed high retention (72–90{\%}), but they also experienced {\textgreater} 50 days of drought stress per year. However, not all species with the same strategy behaved similarly, therefore selecting plants based on water use and drought strategy alone does not guarantee survival in shallow substrates where drought stress can develop quickly. Despite this, it is more likely that green roofs will achieve high rainfall retention with minimal supplementary irrigation if planted with low water users with drought avoidance strategies.},
