# Green Roofs
[@Lundholm2015]

- plant functional can be used to streamline plant selection for green roof ecosystems
collected only leaf and canopy traits (e.g. SLA, LDMC, height and leaf area) that are known for driving productivity and resource uptake
- managed to find some links between plant traits and green roof ecosystem services using a model-averaging approach
- some interesting findings were:
  - stormwater capture rate: shrubs, tall forbs, and then succulents
  - substrate cooling, there was a large variation among the grasses and shrubs,
  - creeping shrubs had the lowest cooling performance
- it appears that succulent monocultures provide the largest benefits for substrate cooling, but a poor performance in terms of stormwater capture.
