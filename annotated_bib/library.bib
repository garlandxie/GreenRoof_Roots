abstract = {Aims Root tissue density (RTD, the ratio of root dry mass to root volume) is a fundamental trait in compara- tive root ecology, being increasingly used as an indicator of plant species' resource use strategy. However, the lack of standardized method to measure this trait makes com- parisons tricky. This study aims to compare three methods commonly used for determining fine RTD and to test whether root dry matter content (RDMC, the ratio between root drymass and root freshmass) could be used as a surrogate of fine root tissue density. Methods RTD of 163 fine root samples was determined using (i) Archimedes' method, (ii) image analysis (WinRHIZO software), and (iii) using the root dry matter content as a proxy. Root samples belonged to different herbaceous species grown in different conditions. Results RTD measured with Archimedes' method was positively correlated with RTD estimated with image analysis and with RDMC. However we demonstrated that RTD measured with Archimedes' method was better predicted by RDMC (R2=0.90) than by RTD measured with image analysis (R2=0.56). The perfor- mance and limitations of each method were discussed. Conclusion RDMCis a quick, cheap and relatively easy measurable root attribute; we thus recommended its measurement as a proxy of fine root tissue density.},

abstract = {Root length and diameter distribution are important characteristics to be considered when describing and comparing root systems. Root length and root-diameter distribution may be obtained in two ways: by microscopical measurements, which are laborious, or by computerised analysis, which is fast but sensitive to the scanning protocol. Although scanning protocols vary widely between laboratories, papers rarely report the details. Using two commercially available root analysis software packages (Delta-T Scan and WinRHIZO), we performed a sensitivity analysis of scanning protocols for estimating root length and diameter distribution. The results are shown graphically, rather than numerically, because the interactions between different parameters in the overall scanning protocol are most clearly illustrated by the shape of the curves. The present analysis clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of the two scanning methods with regard to staining period, maximum root density, scanning resolution and transformation threshold. For example, estimating the root-diameter distribution versus measuring root length, puts opposite constraints on the transformation threshold settings. We suggest the following settings for the most sensitive parameters: a staining period of 24 h, a root density of less than 0.5 mm root per mm(2) surface, a resolution of 400 dpi and the automatic threshold for WinRHIZO and a brightness of 200 for Delta-T Scan. According to this protocol, comparison of computerised analyses with microscopic measurements showed good total root length and diameter distribution agreement for three contrasting root systems. We suggest to always start with the present protocol when studying other species. If validation indicates that the proposed scanning protocol needs to be modified for other species, the present sensitivity analysis may be used as a guideline for changing the most critical parameters. Similarly, the use of another stain than neutral red may also require modifications of the scanning protocol. In general, a long staining period (e.g., 24 h) is recommended for all stains, as small differences in staining period have the least effect when the root tissue is saturated. To enhance comparability of results in the literature, the staining period, stain, (maximum) root density, scanner resolution and threshold should always be listed when root data obtained by scanning are presented.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Green infrastructure is a strategic network of green spaces designed to deliver ecosystem services to human communities. Green infrastructure is a convenient concept for urban policy makers, but the term is used too generically and with limited understanding of the relative values or benefits of different types of green space and how these complement one another. At a finer scale/more practical level, little consideration is given to the composition of the plant communities, yet this is what ultimately defines the extent of service provision. This paper calls for greater attention to be paid to urban plantings with respect to ecosystem service delivery and for plant science to engage more fully in identifying those plants that promote various services. SCOPE: Many urban plantings are designed based on aesthetics alone, with limited thought on how plant choice/composition provides other ecosystem services. Research is beginning to demonstrate, however, that landscape plants provide a range of important services, such as helping mitigate floods and alleviating heat islands, but that not all species are equally effective. The paper reviews a number of important services and demonstrates how genotype choice radically affects service delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Although research is in its infancy, data are being generated that relate plant traits to specific services, thereby helping identify genotypes that optimize service delivery. The urban environment, however, will become exceedingly bland if future planting is simply restricted to monocultures of a few 'functional' genotypes. Therefore, further information is required on how to design plant communities where the plants identified (1) provide more than a single benefit (multifunctionality), (B) complement each other in maximizing the range of benefits that can be delivered in one location, and (3) continue to maintain public acceptance through diversity. The identification/development of functional landscape plants is an exciting and potentially high-impact arena for plant science.},
annote = {Introduction
- lack of specific plant species in current green roof policies
- issue: plant selection has to provide both wider human needs and tolerance to urban enviornments
- using plant traits and genotypes may improve plant selection process
- important in understanding ES provision from popular cultivars (genotypes)
- large focus on street trees and green roofs 

Urban biodiversity
- cultivars may differ in terms of insect visitation 

Rooftop cooling
- multiple mechanisms of how vegetation can provide rooftop cooling (1) shade, (2) evaporatranspiration, (3) thermal to chemical energy, (4) albedo 
- extent of cooling altered by traits such as LAI SLA, stomatal conductance, leaf colour 
- sedums aren't best species to optimize rooftop cooling; species with light-colour non-succulent leaf canopies were more superior
- species that cool via shade: attain multiple layers of leaves
- species that cool via evapotranspiration: provide single layer of evenly spaced leaves 

Energy conservation
- plants can insulate buildings during winter
- shelter from plant trees reduced water energy consumption

Storm-water retention
- water retention was improved by grasses and forbs rather than succulents (based on structural differences)
- ability to recharge storage capacity is important as well (high transpiration rates)

Mitigate soil, aerial + H2O pollutants
- grasses were more effective at particular matter than broad-leaved or succulents, due to complex canopy structures + possessing parallel grooves on their leaes 
- root mass is important for reducint pollutant runoff

Human health and well-being
- alleviate stress + encourage physical activity
- plant-derived volatile chemicals to enhance immune functioning??
- landscape quality influences restoration potential
- phenology plays a big role
- humans have preferences for certain plant forms (flat-topped specimen)

Noise mitigation
- plants can absorb, diffuse + deflect noise
- dense foliage, low forking branches, large leaf size, large branching characteristics

Crime and security 
- regreening urban areas lead to reduction in robbery, burglary, theft and shooting
- tradeoff: plantings can conceal criminals. but can circument this using thorns of sharp serrations

Education and cultural opportunities
- provides connection to nature
- highest engagement can occur in urban centres

Disservices
- some species provide disservices
- some plants attract unwanted insect species
- trees with large amounts of leaf litter are best avoied in pedestrian presincts
- trees with high sugar secretions are not apopriate within car parks 

Multiple benefits
- certain species are better than others in promoting multipe services
- for example, salvia offinalis and stachys byzantina provide rooftop cooling, stormwater retention, increase storage capacity, habitat provision, traps aerial pollutants and provides pollen for honey bees

What Next?
- practitioners tend to perceive plant selection as either what survives well or what looks pretty
- need to chance policymakers' perspective to only "why" plant selection is importamt, but to how "how" and "where" for effective management
- a change in philosophy from "what will survive" to "what provides function". 
- urban design is poor if monocultures are only used},

abstract = {1. Functional root traits are becoming a key measure in plant ecology, and root length measurements are needed for the calculation of root traits. Several methods are used to estimate the total root length (TRL) of washed root samples [e.g. modified line intersect (LI) method, WinRHIZO TM and IJ{\_}Rhizo], but no standardized compar-ison of methods exists. 2. We used a set of digital images of unstained root samples to compare measurements given by the LI method and automated methods provided by WinRHIZO TM and IJ{\_}Rhizo. Linear regression models were used to detect bias. Both linear regression models and the Bland-Altman's method of differences were used to evaluate the accu-racy of eight methods (1 manual, 2 semi-automated and 5 automated) in comparison with a reference method that avoided root detection errors. 3. Length measurements were highly correlated, but did not exactly agree with each other in 11 of 12 method comparisons. All tested methods tended to underestimate the TRL of unstained root samples. The accuracy of WinRHIZO TM was influenced by the thresholding method and the root length density (RLD) in the pictures. For the other methods, no linear relationship was found between accuracy and RLD. With WinRHIZO TM (glo-bal thresholding + pixel reclassification; RLD = 1 cm cm {\`{A}}2), the Regent's method and the Tennant's method underestimated the TRL by 7{\'{A}}0 AE 6{\'{A}}2{\%} and 4{\'{A}}7 AE 7{\'{A}}9{\%}, respectively. The LI method gave satisfactory results on average (underestimation: 4{\'{A}}2 AE 6{\'{A}}0{\%}), but our results suggest that it can lead to inaccurate estimations for single images. In IJ{\_}Rhizo, the Kimura method was the best and underestimated the TRL by 5{\'{A}}4 AE 6{\'{A}}1{\%}. 4. Our results showed that care must be taken when comparing measurements acquired with different methods because they can lead to different results. When acquiring root images, we advise to (i) increase the contrast between fine roots and background by staining the roots, and (ii) avoid overlapping roots by not exceeding a RLD of 1 cm cm {\`{A}}2 . Under these conditions, good length estimates can be obtained with WinRHIZO TM (global thresholding + pixel reclassification). The Kimura method in IJ{\_}Rhizo can be an alternative to WinRHIZO TM .},

abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

abstract = {Image analyses systems provide a quick determination of various root morphological parameters. Generally, a specific testing procedure should be conducted at the beginning of every measurement process. In this study, the performance of two image analyses programs using different measuring algorithms was compared: a commercial package WinRHIZO and a freeware ROOTEDGE. Roots of field grown cereal crops, wheat (Triticum durumDesf.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), were used. Several types of tests were executed: 1. Comparison of image analyses and manually conducted measurements of root length; 2. Comparison between root length, average diameter and surface area measurements performed with ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO; 3. Tests of root arrangement to assess the importance of random orientation of the scanned roots for accurate measurements; 4. Evaluation of the maximum acceptable scanning density (cm scanned root length per cm2 scanning area). The results suggest that ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO provide fairly correct measurements of root morphological parameters. There were small differences between manually and image analyses measurements of root length, in particular using a transparent light unit for scanning. Ratios of image analyses to manual estimations ranged from 0.95 to 1.03 for different root samples of winter barley. Comparisons of the programs generated almost equal root estimates. Discrepancies between diameter and surface area were slightly higher than between length measurements. The average root diameter was a little overestimated by ROOTEDGE compared to WinRHIZO. The most significant source for these discrepancies presumably was the difference between the fixed threshold for ROOTEDGE and the flexible threshold, automatically optimized for every single image by WinRHIZO. ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO image analyses showed small sensitivity to root sample orientation. Estimations of root length, average diameter and surface area were well reproducible. For the scanning density to 3 cm cm-2 CV values for the replicated measurements varied between 0.3{\%} and 3.4{\%} by both programs. High scanning density of roots resulted in increasing underestimation of root length and overestimation of root average diameter. For the common scanning density range in root research between 1 and 3 cm cm-2 discrepancies did not exceed 5{\%}. Higher scanning densities than 3 cm cm-2 are not recommended.},

abstract = {Algorithms for estimating root length by image analysis should lead to results that have no systematic error (bias), be insensitive to preferential root orientation, valid across a wide range of sample sizes and adjust for overlap between roots in samples, to reduce the effort needed in spreading out root systems. We propose a new algorithm that forms a compromise between small bias and robustness (insensitivity to variation in sample size and preferential root orientation), and provide a simple way of dealing with root overlap. Image analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. The digital image of the root was processed to get the thinned image (skeleton). The numbers of orthogonally and diagonally connected pairs of pixels (No andNd, respectively) in the skeletonwere counted separately and used for length (L) calculation.A new length calculation equation was introduced so that the effect of orientation on length calculation was minimized; L =[Nd2 + (Nd + No/2)2]1/2 + No/2. The maximum error due to orientation of a single line was evaluated for an ideal line, and the analysis revealed that the new equation was less affected by orientation than previous equations. Copper wire and rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots containing both primary and fine secondary root were measured manually andwith image analysis. The two methods showed good agreementwithin 1.5{\%}. The proposed image analysis method yielded length estimates with CV from 0.23 to 0.88{\%}, which was lower than the CVs of the line-intersect method. Moreover, the lengths of overlapping samples were calculated correctly because the image analysis method distinguished an overlapping pixel from a thinned image, while the calculation with the line-intersect method showed underestimation because overlaps were not considered in that method.},

abstract = {Constructed ecosystems such as green roofs often contain monocultures or low-diversity plant communities, but adding more plant species to these systems can increase ecosystem service provisioning. Mixture advantage, when species-rich treatments outperform the best monocultures, is desirable in constructed ecosystems due to the cost of increasing diversity. However, there have not been any studies in constructed ecosystems that have quantitatively compared mixtures with the best monocultures for multifunctionality, and there have been few studies that have examined how provision of ecosystem services changes over time as plant communities develop. In a green roof system, I predicted (i) that the mixture advantage would be stronger for ecosystem multifunctionality than for single ecosystem functions and (ii) that ecosystem service provisioning and complementarity in above-ground biomass would increase over time. Fifteen monocultures of plant species from five life-form groups (succulents, tall forbs, dwarf shrubs, creeping forbs, grasses) were compared with three-species mixtures of the same life-form and mixtures of species from three and five different life-forms in a modular green roof system. Indicators of ecosystem services including above-ground production, thermal regulation, stormwater retention, nutrient uptake and carbon sequestration and two indices of ecosystem multifunctionality were compared. Canopy density increased over time while substrate temperature decreased, suggesting higher provisioning of valuable ecosystem services. For single services, the positive relationship between planted species richness and ecosystem service grew stronger over time, but was consistently strong over time for multifunctionality. Quantile regression indicated a weak mixture advantage for several services including both multifunctionality indices. While the effects were small, different species optimized different functions, thus multifunctioning is enhanced in more diverse mixtures by combining species that maximize different functions. Tripartite partitioning of canopy density showed that overyielding and trait-independent complementarity fluctuated between years in response to shifts in species abundances, but dominance and trait-dependent complementarity increased over time. Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first evidence in a constructed ecosystem that mixtures can outperform the best monocultures for multiple ecosystem services. Mixtures of plant life-forms can improve green roof performance. The biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships observed in natural ecosystems can also occur in novel and highly simplified engineered ecosystems.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Green roofs perform ecosystem services such as summer roof temperature reduction and stormwater capture that directly contribute to lower building energy use and potential economic savings. These services are in turn related to ecosystem functions performed by the vegetation layer such as radiation reflection and transpiration, but little work has examined the role of plant species composition and diversity in improving these functions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a replicated modular extensive (shallow growing- medium) green roof system planted with monocultures or mixtures containing one, three or five life-forms, to quantify two ecosystem services: summer roof cooling and water capture. We also measured the related ecosystem properties/processes of albedo, evapotranspiration, and the mean and temporal variability of aboveground biomass over four months. Mixtures containing three or five life-form groups, simultaneously optimized several green roof ecosystem functions, outperforming monocultures and single life-form groups, but there was much variation in performance depending on which life-forms were present in the three life-form mixtures. Some mixtures outperformed the best monocultures for water capture, evapotranspiration, and an index combining both water capture and temperature reductions. Combinations of tall forbs, grasses and succulents simultaneously optimized a range of ecosystem performance measures, thus the main benefit of including all three groups was not to maximize any single process but to perform a variety of functions well.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ecosystem services from green roofs can be improved by planting certain life-form groups in combination, directly contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. The strong performance by certain mixtures of life-forms, especially tall forbs, grasses and succulents, warrants further investigation into niche complementarity or facilitation as mechanisms governing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in green roof ecosystems.},

abstract = {Plants make important contributions to the services provided by engineered ecosystems such as green roofs. Ecologists use plant species traits as generic predictors of geographical distribution, interactions with other species, and ecosystem functioning, but this approach has been little used to optimize engineered ecosystems. Four plant species traits (height, individual leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) were evaluated as predictors of ecosystem properties and services in a modular green roof system planted with 21 species. Six indicators of ecosystem services, incorporating thermal, hydrological, water quality, and carbon sequestration functions, were predicted by the four plant traits directly or indirectly via their effects on aggregate ecosystem properties, including canopy density and albedo. Species average height and specific leaf area were the most useful traits, predicting several services via effects on canopy density or growth rate. This study demonstrates that easily measured plant traits can be used to select species to optimize green roof performance across multiple key services.},

abstract = {In this paper, we have reviewed how the hydraulic design of trees influences the movement of water from roots to leaves. The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

abstract = {Background and aims  This paper provides an overview of the measuring capabilities of IJ{\_}Rhizo, an ImageJ macro that measures scanned images of washed root samples. IJ{\_}Rhizo is open-source, platform-independent and offers a simple graphic user interface (GUI) for a main audience of non-programmer scientists. Being open-source based, it is also fully modifiable to accommodate the specific needs of the more computer-literate users. A comparison of IJ{\_}Rhizo's performance with that of the widely used commercial package WinRHIZO™ is discussed. Methods  We compared IJ{\_}Rhizo's performance with that of the commercial package WinRHIZO™ using two sets of images, one comprising test-line images, the second consisting of images of root samples collected in the field. IJ{\_}Rhizo and WinRHIZO™ estimates were compared by means of correlation and regression analysis. Results  IJ{\_}Rhizo “Kimura” and WinRHIZO™ “Tennant” were the length estimates that were best linearly correlated with each other. Correlation between average root diameter estimates was weaker, due to the sensitivity of this parameter to thresholding and filtering of image background noise. Conclusions  Overall, IJ{\_}Rhizo offers new opportunities for researchers who cannot afford the cost of commercial software packages to carry out automated measurement of scanned images of root samples, without sacrificing accuracy.},

abstract = {Every year thousands of experiments are conducted using plants grown under more-or-less controlled environmental conditions. The aim of many such experiments is to compare the phenotype of different species or genotypes in a specific environment, or to study plant performance under a range of suboptimal conditions. Our paper aims to bring together the minimum knowledge necessary for a plant biologist to set up such experiments and apply the environmental conditions that are appropriate to answer the questions of interest. We first focus on the basic choices that have to be made with regard to the experimental setup (e.g. where are the plants grown; what rooting medium; what pot size). Second, we present practical considerations concerning the number of plants that have to be analysed considering the variability in plant material and the required precision. Third, we discuss eight of the most important environmental factors for plant growth (light quantity, light quality, CO2, nutrients, air humidity, water, temperature and salinity); what critical issues should be taken into account to ensure proper growth conditions in controlled environments and which specific aspects need attention if plants are challenged with a certain a-biotic stress factor. Finally, we propose a simple checklist that could be used for tracking and reporting experimental conditions.},

abstract = {Specific root length (SRL) and root tissue density (RTD) are ecologically functional traits which are calculated from root length or volume and root dry weight. Both can be converted into each other using the root diameter assuming roots are cylindrical. The calculation of volume from length or length from volume is, however, problematic because samples of roots do usually not have a constant diameter. Ignorance of the diameter heterogeneity leads to an overestimation of length and an underestimation of volume if standard formulas are used. Here I show for two datasets that SRL and RTD are overestimated on average 67{\%} for the two analyzed datasets, but up to 150{\%}, if calculated from each other. I further highlight that the volume values for the total sample as provided by the commonly used software WinRHIZO(TM) should only be used for objects with constant diameter. I recommend to use volume values provided for each diameter class of a sample if WinRHIZO(TM) is used. If manual methods, like the line-intersect method, are used, roots should be separated into diameter classes before length measurements if the volume is calculated from length. Trait to trait conversions for whole samples are not recommended.},

abstract = {Green roofs are increasingly being used among the suite of tools designed to reduce the volume of surface water runoff generated by cities. Plants provide the primary mechanism for restoring the rainfall retention capacity of green roofs, but selecting plants with high water use is likely to increase drought stress. Using empirically-derived plant physiological parameters, we used a water balance model to assess the trade-off between rainfall retention and plant drought stress under a 30-year climate scenario. We compared high and low water users with either drought avoidance or drought tolerance strategies. Green roofs with low water-using, drought-avoiding species achieved high rainfall retention (66–81{\%}) without experiencing significant drought stress. Roofs planted with other strategies showed high retention (72–90{\%}), but they also experienced {\textgreater} 50 days of drought stress per year. However, not all species with the same strategy behaved similarly, therefore selecting plants based on water use and drought strategy alone does not guarantee survival in shallow substrates where drought stress can develop quickly. Despite this, it is more likely that green roofs will achieve high rainfall retention with minimal supplementary irrigation if planted with low water users with drought avoidance strategies.},

abstract = {Green roofs are increasingly being considered a promising engineered ecosystem for reducing stormwater runoff. Plants are a critical component of green roofs and it has been suggested that plants with high water use after rainfall, but which are also drought tolerant, can improve rainfall retention on green roofs. However, there is little evidence to show how plants with different water use strategies will affect green roof retention performance, either in monocultures or in mixed plantings. This study tested how monocultures and a mixture of herbaceous species (Dianella admixta, Lomandra longifolia and Stypandra glauca) affected rainfall retention on green roofs. These species were chosen based on their water use strategies and compared with a commonly used succulent species (Sedum pachyphyllum) with conservative water use. We measured retention performance for 67 rainfall events, quantifying all components of the water balance. We also compared growth for species in monocultures and mixtures. We found that monocultures of L. longifolia had the greatest stormwater retention and ET. Although S. glauca has a similar water use strategy to D. admixta, it had the lowest stormwater retention and ET. In both the mixture and as a monoculture, S. glauca created preferential flow pathways, resulting in lower substrate water contents which reduced ET and therefore rainfall retention. This species also dominated performance of the mixture, such that the mixture had lower ET and retention than all monocultures (except S. glauca). We suggest that root traits and their interaction with substrates should be considered alongside water use strategies for rainfall retention on green roofs.},
