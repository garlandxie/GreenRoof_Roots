# Green Roofs
[@Lundholm2015:2] Lundholm et al. 2015. Env Sci Tech

- plant functional can be used to streamline plant selection for green roof ecosystems
collected only leaf and canopy traits (e.g. SLA, LDMC, height and leaf area) that are known for driving productivity and resource uptake
- managed to find some links between plant traits and green roof ecosystem services using a model-averaging approach
- some interesting findings were:
  - stormwater capture rate: shrubs had the highest performance, followed by grasses and succulents
  - substrate cooling: large variation among the grasses and shrubs
  - creeping shrubs had the lowest cooling performance
- it appears that succulent monocultures provide the largest benefits for substrate cooling, but a poor performance in terms of stormwater capture.

[@Lundholm2015] Lundholm. 2015. J Appl Ecol
- determine the impacts of green plant species  diversity on multiple ecosystem services
- experimental approach: monocultures, 9 species mixture,  and 15 species mixture
- used quantile regression to see if best-performing polycultures out-performed the best-performing monocultures for multiple services (stormwater capture, cooling, nutrient runoff, ecosystem multifunctionality)
- found that species richness was positively correlated with several services, including ecosystem multifunctionality
- four-year period: an increase in both trait-dependent complementarity and dominance

[@Lundholm2010] Lundholm et al. 2010. PLOS one
- examined if the impact of multiple vegetative life forms outperformed monocultures for several ecosystem services (e..g, stormwater capture, substrate cooling). 
- found that multiple life-forms within a single module had:
  - higher stormwater and substrate cooling than monocultures
  - indicating that a role of sampling effect or niche complementarity
- transpiration and water-uptake are two physiological processes that govern:
  - substrate cooling
  - stormwater retention 
- belowground spatial niche complementarity 
  - partially responsible for the two ecosystem services
  - selected species have variation in their root traits 
  - (e.g. dense and clustered fibrous roots versus rhizomes)
  
[@Lundholm2015] Lundholm. 2015. Front Evo Evo   
- ecological and evolutionary relevance of constructed ecosystems 
  - (e.g., green roofs, constructed wetlands, bioretention filters)
- defines constructed ecosystems “as a set of living and nonliving components”
  - designed to provide valuable services”
- distinctive features that separate constructed ecosystems:
  - (1) relatively simple designs
  - (2) small sizes
  - (3) ecological novelty (lack of historical evolutionary select pressures)
  - (4) the role of human design 
- socioeconomic factors play a role in the design of constructed ecosystems
  - such as the identity of the designer
  - ecologists can learn about community assembly from constructed ecosystems 
  - (e.g. start simple to more complex) 
  - no initial biological legacy to begin with
- evolutionary issues should exist in constructed ecosystem 
  - due to the relatively homogeneous conditions 
  - high levels of ecological novelty

[@Farrell2013] Farell et al. 2013. Plant Soil 
- habitat template approach to find high-water users with drought tolerance
- plant from granite outcrops were chosen as candidate species 
  - xerophytes adapted to limited-water conditions
  - geophytes will lose leaves in unfavourable conditions, but will remain alive
- for optimal performance, green roofs need to restore storage capacity as soon as possible
- tested physiological traits of 12 granite outcrop species in a glasshouse experiment 
- granite outcrop species outperform sedum succulents for stormwater runoff
- monocots and herbs had the highest transpiration rates due to high RMF
- but, mixtures with high drought-resistance and high stormwater performance is key

[@Szota2017] Szota et al. 2017. Sci Total Env
- selecting green roof plants has to balance both drought risk and stormwater retention
- “around 60-80% of rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration in natural ecosystems”
- green roofs should aim to achieve 80% rainfall lost to evapotranspiration
- stormwater retention is caused by different engineering components in the system
  - adding artificial components increase water retention, but adds extra weight 
  - green roof soil tend to have high hydraulic conductivity --> free-draining
- adding retention layers can help, but might be too heavy in some cases
- high water-users can restore storage capacity quickly, but can suffer from drought
  - drought avoiders - “isohydric”: tight stomatal regulation, maintain water status
  - drought-tolerant - “anisohydric”: decrease water status; but risks hydraulic failure
- natural ecosystems: drought-resistant plants develop extensive roots to acquire water
- but, may not work on green roofs due to limited water 
- some notes on methods:
  - Used previous climatic dataset to help simulate realistic rainfall events 
  - acquired crop coefficients as part of water balance model 
- main findings:
  - high crop factor (>1) increased water retention, but suffered from drought  
  - plants with crop factors (0.6 < k < 1) with drought avoidance --> ideal for balancing stormwater retention and drought risk

[@Zhang2018] Zhang et al. 2018. STOTEN ref

- tested green roof monoculture and mixtures on stormwater retention based on water-use strategies
- based in Australia (warm dry ecosystem); need to optimize rainfall retention and plant survival 
- plants needs to have high transpiration after rainfall and survive dry period
- biodiversity may improve retention through transgressive overyielding and selection effect
- life-form diversity is likely complicated by differences in biomass and rainfall interceptions
  - grass monocultures have higher retention than some life-form mixtures
  - possibility: unmeasured traits may affect retention
- used plants with different water-use strategies (plastic, conservative)
- green roofs captured at least 73% of rainfall
- retention was not always higher in mixtures than monocultures
  - affected by watering regime --> water-use strategies
- certain sedum species have poor ability to retain water
  - root systems create large pore channels that increased water flow in substrate
  - created a selection effect (i.e., high cover) and reduced water retention performance

# Methodology 

[@Perez-Harguindeguy2013] Pérez-Harguindeguy et al. 2013. Austr J Botany

- root mass fraction
  - distribution of biomass to roots
  - best way is to look at turnover rates; but it's time-consuming
  - otherwise, root:shoot ratio works well since this metric is bounded at 0 to 1
  - fast-growers tend to have higher RMF
  - although, high RMF doesn’t always mean a high resource-uptake rate
  - if similar mass, RMF works well. If not, try to use allometries for range of different masses
- specific root length
  - “ratio of root length to dry mass of fine roots”; comparable to SLA
  - species high SRL still might have low tissue density; need to measure both!
  - roots grown in pots constrain age; rule of thumb is that roots should fit in palm
- processing root samples:
  - unwashed roots can be stored for about a week without a lot of damage
  - 50% ethanol solution might work well to preserve root for a while 
  - gently wash low-density roots; hose down high-dense roots
  - speed of washing roots depends on soil type; sandy soil is the best!
  - stop washing roots when you lose some fine roots, then pluck away
  - sort live roots from dead roots with a dissecting microscope
  - after that, digitize them using a low end-flatbanner (ideally 1600 dpi)
  - roots appear crisp and clean if submerged in a bit of water within a tray
  - after scanning, roots should be dried for 48hr @ 60 C
- root-system morphology
  - maximum rooting depth
  - lateral extent
  - intensity of exploration

[@Pierret2013] Pierret et al. 2013. Plant Soil
- talks about the potential use of a free open-source software "IJ_RHIZO",
  - compares both root length and average root diameter 
- to test if the Kimura IJ_RHIZO is unbiased compared to Tennant WinRHIZO
- WinRHIZO Tennant and Kimura IJ_RHIZO were highly correlated for root length
- estimates (r = 0.99), with a slight overestimation of the latter estimator
- average root diameter estimate had a weaker correlation between the two estimators,
- advantage of IJ_Rhizo is that it provides the root radius distribution
- WinRHIZO uses TIF images while IJ_Rhiz uses JPEG

[@Bouma2000] Bouma et al. 2000. Plant Soil. Recs for scanning root traits 
- specific root length = ability for plants to explore soil + resource uptake
- measuring root length can take some time; requires faster methods
- we can automate this measurement, but it’s still sensitive to proposed parameters
- thus, sensitivity analyses for SRL are needed (Delta-T Scan + WinRHIZO)
- used three grass species; took six root samples from each individual + stained red 
  - *Spartina anglica* 
  - *Puccinellia maritima*
  - *Elymus pycnanthus*
- root hair may interfere with root length measurement
- recommendations (and report this too!)
  - do a quick line-intersect method on new species (obs > 400)
  - stain for 24 hours using neutral red (although this might vary per species)
  - sample density (0.5 mm mm−2)
  - scanning resolution (400 dpi) 	
  - scanning threshold 
  
  
[@Birouste2014] Birouste et al. 2014. Plant Soil 
- tissue density - “amount of structural material invested by unit of volume”
- low-dense tissue means fast growth; rapid expansion with low carbon cost
- but.. low root lifespan and vulnerable to pathogens + herbivory 
- clearly an important plant strategy but there is no standard way to measure it
- different terminologies exist too (so confusing when read different papers!):
  - e.g., root tissue density, root dry matter content (RDMC), root mass density, root specific gravity
- three methods exists so far: Archimedes, image analysis, RDMC
- RDMC is the cheapest, quick method (I prefer this):
  - seems like an analogue to leaf dry matter content (LDMC)
  - calculation: root dry weight/root fresh weight
  - linked by root density (which is assumed to be approximately 1)
- root fresh weight is a proxy for root volume
- R2 (0.97%) for pot grown species compared to Archimedes method
- underestimation may be higher proportion of air spaces 
- need to account for water saturation when measuring fresh weight 
- image analysis were really sensitive to proposed parameters + thresholds
