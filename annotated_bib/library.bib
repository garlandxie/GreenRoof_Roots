abstract = {As plant roots take up water and the soil dries, water depletion is expected to occur in the rhizosphere. However, recent experiments showed that the rhizosphere was wetter than the bulk soil during root water uptake. We hypothesise that the increased water content in the rhizosphere was caused by mucilage exuded by roots. It is probably that the higher water content in the rhizosphere results in higher hydraulic conductivity of the root–soil interface. In this case, mucilage exudation would favour the uptake of water in dry soils. To test this hypothesis, we covered a suction cup, referred to as an artificial root, with mucilage. We placed it in soil with a water content of 0.03 cm3 cm–3, and used the root pressure probe technique to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the root–soil continuum. The results were compared with measurements with roots not covered with mucilage. The root pressure relaxation curves were fitted with a model of root water uptake including rhizosphere dynamics. The results demonstrated that when mucilage is added to the root surface, it keeps the soil near the roots wet and hydraulically well conductive, facilitating the water flow from dry soils towards the root surface. Mucilage exudation seems to be an optimal plant trait that favours the capture of water when water is scarce.},

abstract = {Trait-based approaches, which focus on the functional characteristics of organisms rather than their taxonomic identity, offer a means to explain how plant communities and ecosystem functions respond to environmental change. Here I review recent developments in the use of plant trait-based approaches for interrogating the functioning of soils and their response to global change. Plant traits impact soil functioning via multiple routes with feedback consequences for biogeochemical cycles and plant community dynamics. They also display a high degree of plasticity in response to global change; as such, there is much potential for global change-induced shifts in trait spectra, both aboveground and belowground, to impact soil functions with feedbacks to biogeochemical cycling across multiple scales. Recent research reveals that root traits play a particularly important role in influencing the soil environment, with strong impacts on a host of physical, chemical and biological soil properties. Although a fast-moving topic, many challenges regarding the use of trait-based approaches to interrogate soil functioning remain. I identify three. First, there is a need for improved understanding of genotypic- and species-level variation in plant traits, especially of root traits that have the strongest potential to influence soil function. Second, there is a need to incorporate new understanding of links between plant traits and soil processes into terrestrial biogeochemical and dynamic vegetation models, in order to enhance their predictive power. Finally, there is a need to harness new understanding of plant traits and their impact on soil functions in sustainable food production systems, in particular to enhance resource acquisition by crop plants. This last point is especially important given the extent that soils are degraded worldwide, and the need to develop sustainable ways of managing soil to prevent further degradation whilst also increasing the production of food.

Using random forest algorithms, we built predictive models of six root traits from 97 aboveground morphological, ecological and life history traits. * Root tissue density was best predicted by leaf dry matter content, whereas traits related to root fineness were best predicted by diaspore mass: the heavier the diaspore, the coarser the root system. Specific leaf area (SLA) was not an important predictor for any of the root traits. * This study confirms the hypothesis that root traits are more than analogues of leaf traits within a plant economics spectrum. The results reveal a novel ecological pattern and highlight the power of root data to close important knowledge gaps in trait-based ecology.},

However, the lack of standardized method to measure this trait makes com- parisons tricky. This study aims to compare three methods commonly used for determining fine RTD and to test whether root dry matter content (RDMC, the ratio between root drymass and root freshmass) could be used as a surrogate of fine root tissue density. Methods RTD of 163 fine root samples was determined using (i) Archimedes' method, (ii) image analysis (WinRHIZO software), and (iii) using the root dry matter content as a proxy. Root samples belonged to different herbaceous species grown in different conditions. Results RTD measured with Archimedes' method was positively correlated with RTD estimated with image analysis and with RDMC. However we demonstrated that RTD measured with Archimedes' method was better predicted by RDMC (R2=0.90) than by RTD measured with image analysis (R2=0.56). The perfor- mance and limitations of each method were discussed. Conclusion RDMCis a quick, cheap and relatively easy measurable root attribute; we thus recommended its measurement as a proxy of fine root tissue density.},

abstract = {Root length and diameter distribution are important characteristics to be considered when describing and comparing root systems. Root length and root-diameter distribution may be obtained in two ways: by microscopical measurements, which are laborious, or by computerised analysis, which is fast but sensitive to the scanning protocol. Although scanning protocols vary widely between laboratories, papers rarely report the details. Using two commercially available root analysis software packages (Delta-T Scan and WinRHIZO), we performed a sensitivity analysis of scanning protocols for estimating root length and diameter distribution. The results are shown graphically, rather than numerically, because the interactions between different parameters in the overall scanning protocol are most clearly illustrated by the shape of the curves. The present analysis clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of the two scanning methods with regard to staining period, maximum root density, scanning resolution and transformation threshold. For example, estimating the root-diameter distribution versus measuring root length, puts opposite constraints on the transformation threshold settings. We suggest the following settings for the most sensitive parameters: a staining period of 24 h, a root density of less than 0.5 mm root per mm(2) surface, a resolution of 400 dpi and the automatic threshold for WinRHIZO and a brightness of 200 for Delta-T Scan. According to this protocol, comparison of computerised analyses with microscopic measurements showed good total root length and diameter distribution agreement for three contrasting root systems. We suggest to always start with the present protocol when studying other species. If validation indicates that the proposed scanning protocol needs to be modified for other species, the present sensitivity analysis may be used as a guideline for changing the most critical parameters. Similarly, the use of another stain than neutral red may also require modifications of the scanning protocol. In general, a long staining period (e.g., 24 h) is recommended for all stains, as small differences in staining period have the least effect when the root tissue is saturated. To enhance comparability of results in the literature, the staining period, stain, (maximum) root density, scanner resolution and threshold should always be listed when root data obtained by scanning are presented.},

annote = {Introduction
- lack of specific plant species in current green roof policies
- issue: plant selection has to provide both wider human needs and tolerance to urban enviornments
- using plant traits and genotypes may improve plant selection process
- important in understanding ES provision from popular cultivars (genotypes)
- large focus on street trees and green roofs 

Urban biodiversity
- cultivars may differ in terms of insect visitation 

Rooftop cooling
- multiple mechanisms of how vegetation can provide rooftop cooling (1) shade, (2) evaporatranspiration, (3) thermal to chemical energy, (4) albedo 
- extent of cooling altered by traits such as LAI SLA, stomatal conductance, leaf colour 
- sedums aren't best species to optimize rooftop cooling; species with light-colour non-succulent leaf canopies were more superior
- species that cool via shade: attain multiple layers of leaves
- species that cool via evapotranspiration: provide single layer of evenly spaced leaves 

Energy conservation
- plants can insulate buildings during winter
- shelter from plant trees reduced water energy consumption

Storm-water retention
- water retention was improved by grasses and forbs rather than succulents (based on structural differences)
- ability to recharge storage capacity is important as well (high transpiration rates)

Mitigate soil, aerial + H2O pollutants
- grasses were more effective at particular matter than broad-leaved or succulents, due to complex canopy structures + possessing parallel grooves on their leaes 
- root mass is important for reducint pollutant runoff

Human health and well-being
- alleviate stress + encourage physical activity
- plant-derived volatile chemicals to enhance immune functioning??
- landscape quality influences restoration potential
- phenology plays a big role
- humans have preferences for certain plant forms (flat-topped specimen)

Noise mitigation
- plants can absorb, diffuse + deflect noise
- dense foliage, low forking branches, large leaf size, large branching characteristics

Crime and security 
- regreening urban areas lead to reduction in robbery, burglary, theft and shooting
- tradeoff: plantings can conceal criminals. but can circument this using thorns of sharp serrations

Education and cultural opportunities
- provides connection to nature
- highest engagement can occur in urban centres

Disservices
- some species provide disservices
- some plants attract unwanted insect species
- trees with large amounts of leaf litter are best avoied in pedestrian presincts
- trees with high sugar secretions are not apopriate within car parks 

Multiple benefits
- certain species are better than others in promoting multipe services
- for example, salvia offinalis and stachys byzantina provide rooftop cooling, stormwater retention, increase storage capacity, habitat provision, traps aerial pollutants and provides pollen for honey bees

What Next?
- practitioners tend to perceive plant selection as either what survives well or what looks pretty
- need to chance policymakers' perspective to only "why" plant selection is importamt, but to how "how" and "where" for effective management
- a change in philosophy from "what will survive" to "what provides function". 
- urban design is poor if monocultures are only used},

We grew barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Pallas) and its root-hairless mutant brb in a root pres- sure chamber, whereby the transpiration rate could be varied whilst monitoring the suction in the xylem. The method provides accurate measurements of the dynamic relationship between the transpiration rate and xylem suction. ? The relationship between the transpiration rate and xylem suction was linear in wet soils and did not differ between genotypes. When the soil dried, the xylem suction increased rapidly and non-linearly at high transpiration rates. This response was much greater with the brb mutant, implying a reduced capacity to take up water. ? We conclude that root hairs facilitate the uptake of water by substantially reducing the drop in matric potential at the interface between root and soil in rapidly transpiring plants. The experiments also reinforce earlier observations that there is a marked hysteresis in the suction in the xylem when the transpiration rate is rising compared with when it is falling, and possible reasons for this behavior are discussed.},

abstract = {Traditional construction practices provide little opportunity for environmental remediation to occur in urban areas. As concerns for environmental improvement in urban areas become more prevalent, innovative practices which create ecosystem services and ecologically functional land cover in cities will be in higher demand. Green roofs are a prime example of one of these practices. The past decade has seen the North American green roof industry rapidly expand through international green roof conferences, demonstration sites, case studies, and scientific research. This study evaluates existing international and North American green roof policies at the federal, municipal, and community levels. Green roof policies fall into a number of general categories, including direct and indirect regulation, direct and indirect financial incentives, and funding of demonstration or research projects. Advantages and disadvantages of each category are discussed. Salient features and a list of prompting standards common to successfully implemented green roof strategies are then distilled from these existing policies. By combining these features with data collected from an experimental green roof site in Athens, Georgia, the planning and regulatory framework for widespread green roof infrastructure can be developed. The authors propose policy instruments be multi-faceted and spatially focused, and also propose the following recommendations: (1) Identification of green roof overlay zones with specifications for green roofs built in these zones. This spatial analysis is important for prioritizing areas of the jurisdiction where green roofs will most efficiently function; (2) Offer financial incentives in the form of density credits and stormwater utility fee credits to help overcome the barriers to entry of the new technology; (3) Construct demonstration projects and institutionalize a commitment greening roofs on publicly-owned buildings as an effective way of establishing an educated roofing industry and experienced installers for future green roof construction.},

- green roof policies are most effective where:
(1) high drainage basin
(2) dense populations
(3) can use GIS to find out optimal areas
- large advocacy group: non-profit GRHC
- individuals play a curcial role as well! 

Application of Green Roof Policy
test case: Athens, GA
- land-use: lots of grey space, bustlin' urban area,
- used green roof test plot at university

Built Infrastructure 
- stormwater system distinct from sanitary sewer

Regulatory Infrastructure 
- committee wants a stormwater utility (quanity, quality and base fee)
- currently, construction fees doesn't have to follow environemntally friendly practices
- limits to floor area ratio depending on zoning class (maximum FAR is 5.0)

Policy Recommendations
- important for political body to clearly define goals it wants to accomplish
- urban greening initiatives may be defined for green corridors, but not green construction
- most effective green roof polocy in ACC: spatially focused + multifaceted; spatial tarets are govenrment, commercial and industrial
- good criteria for green roof construction
(1) flat roofs are eligible for credit programs
(2) min thickness of growing medium: 3 inches
(3) vegetative, growing media + specialized roofing layers must be installed according to manufacturer specifications
(4) green roof mainenance plan must be submitted
(5) modules: a min area of 50{\%} must be greened for roofs to qualify for credit programs

Technology Standards
- mandate roof greening in public building is recommended
- positive ecosystem services from green roof plants

Indirect Financial Incentives
- recommends stormwater utility credit for green roof installation
- GSMM currenty does not reference green roofs as a stormwater volume mitigation tool
- allowing green roofs to count towards the stormwater volume credit (independent of GSMM) may be an easier task
- analysis of runoff data collected at green roof site == water quantity credit == 1.78/mo
- floor area bonuses; a form of density credits when green roof are installed in the green roof district overlays

Discussion and conclusion
- finding ways to repair damaged environment in urban landscape is hard
- more tools for practitioners == more flexibility
- different policies at different governmental levels
- policy effects are difficult to track},

We contrasted 11 fast- and slow-growing species paired within five evolutionary lineages to investigate whether root traits associated with soil resource acquisition were related to species' potential growth rate.
* 2Measurements of root morphology, architecture, nitrogen and phenolic concentration, respiration and phosphorus uptake were taken on fine, non-woody roots sampled from forest stands in central Pennsylvania, USA.
* 3Across all five contrasts, roots of fast-growing species generally had higher specific root length, smaller diameters, greater degree of branching, and lower phenolic concentrations than those of slow-growing species. This suggests differences in potential soil exploration and root defences among species differing in potential growth rate.
* 4There were no significant differences between fast- and slow-growing species in root tissue density, respiration or P uptake. Lack of root physiological differences between species differing in growth rate contrasted with previous research on chamber-grown seedlings.
* 5These results imply that, while roots of fast-growing species may be constructed for more rapid soil exploration and shorter life span than those of slow-growing species, root physiology is either more closely tied to overall plant physiology, which is more similar among mature trees, or masked by variation in soil microsites, root age or interactions with mycorrhizal fungi.},

abstract = {On the basis of a synthesis of recent progress in belowground ecology, we advance and discuss a hypothesis that relates root trait evolution to the increased dominance of angiosperms into dry upland habitats and the decline of atmospheric CO2 concentration that began in the Cretaceous. Our hypothesis is built from examining patterns of fine root adaptations during the Cretaceous, when angiosperms dramatically diversified in association with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal root-fungal symbionts. We then explore the potential effects of root adaptations and mycorrhizas on the geochemical carbon cycle. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses of root traits among extant plant species, we suggest that angiosperm taxa, which diversified since the early Cretaceous, evolved thinner roots with greater root length per unit of biomass invested (i.e., specific root length [SRL]) than earlier diverging taxa. We suggest that these changes in root morphology were facilitated by a decline in atmospheric CO2, which likely caused water to become more limiting and nutrients more bound to organic matter. Under these conditions, we suggest that thin roots with long SRL would have allowed plants to more efficiently forage for soil water and nutrients.

abstract = {On the basis of a synthesis of recent progress in belowground ecology, we advance and discuss a hypothesis that relates root trait evolution to the increased dominance of angiosperms into dry upland habitats and the decline of atmospheric CO2 concentration that began in the Cretaceous. Our hypothesis is built from examining patterns of fine root adaptations during the Cretaceous, when angiosperms dramatically diversified in association with arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal root-fungal symbionts. We then explore the potential effects of root adaptations and mycorrhizas on the geochemical carbon cycle. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses of root traits among extant plant species, we suggest that angiosperm taxa, which diversified since the early Cretaceous, evolved thinner roots with greater root length per unit of biomass invested (i.e., specific root length [SRL]) than earlier diverging taxa. We suggest that these changes in root morphology were facilitated by a decline in atmospheric CO2, which likely caused water to become more limiting and nutrients more bound to organic matter. Under these conditions, we suggest that thin roots with long SRL would have allowed plants to more efficiently forage for soil water and nutrients. This assertion is supported by the observation that SRL correlates with greater root length density in soil and increased root capacity to take up water. Simulations indicate that the evolution of angiosperm root systems with greater SRL and ectomycorrhizas during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic substantially increased mineral weathering rates, with a fourfold increase in SRL, equivalent to a quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 concentration.

abstract = {1. Functional root traits are becoming a key measure in plant ecology, and root length measurements are needed for the calculation of root traits. Several methods are used to estimate the total root length (TRL) of washed root samples [e.g. modified line intersect (LI) method, WinRHIZO TM and IJ{\_}Rhizo], but no standardized compar-ison of methods exists. 2. We used a set of digital images of unstained root samples to compare measurements given by the LI method and automated methods provided by WinRHIZO TM and IJ{\_}Rhizo. Linear regression models were used to detect bias. Both linear regression models and the Bland-Altman's method of differences were used to evaluate the accu-racy of eight methods (1 manual, 2 semi-automated and 5 automated) in comparison with a reference method that avoided root detection errors. 3. Length measurements were highly correlated, but did not exactly agree with each other in 11 of 12 method comparisons. All tested methods tended to underestimate the TRL of unstained root samples. The accuracy of WinRHIZO TM was influenced by the thresholding method and the root length density (RLD) in the pictures. For the other methods, no linear relationship was found between accuracy and RLD. With WinRHIZO TM (glo-bal thresholding + pixel reclassification; RLD = 1 cm cm {\`{A}}2), the Regent's method and the Tennant's method underestimated the TRL by 7{\'{A}}0 AE 6{\'{A}}2{\%} and 4{\'{A}}7 AE 7{\'{A}}9{\%}, respectively. The LI method gave satisfactory results on average (underestimation: 4{\'{A}}2 AE 6{\'{A}}0{\%}), but our results suggest that it can lead to inaccurate estimations for single images. In IJ{\_}Rhizo, the Kimura method was the best and underestimated the TRL by 5{\'{A}}4 AE 6{\'{A}}1{\%}. 4. Our results showed that care must be taken when comparing measurements acquired with different methods because they can lead to different results. When acquiring root images, we advise to (i) increase the contrast between fine roots and background by staining the roots, and (ii) avoid overlapping roots by not exceeding a RLD of 1 cm cm {\`{A}}2 . Under these conditions, good length estimates can be obtained with WinRHIZO TM (global thresholding + pixel reclassification). The Kimura method in IJ{\_}Rhizo can be an alternative to WinRHIZO TM .},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 US Government (outside the USA) Aims: Root-specific responses to stress are not well-known, and have been largely based on indirect measurements of bulk soil water extraction, which limits mechanistic modeling of root function. Methods: Here, we used neutron radiography to examine in situ root-soil water dynamics of a previously droughted black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) seedling, contrasting water uptake by the two major components of the root system that differed in initial recovery rate as apparent by ‘new' (whiter, thinner), or ‘old' (darker, thicker) parts of the fine root system. Results: The smaller diameter ‘new' roots had greater water uptake per unit surface area than the larger diameter ‘old' roots, but they had less total surface area leading to less total water extraction; rates ranged from 0.0027–0.0116 g cm −2 h −1 . The finest most-active roots were not visible in the radiographs, indicating the need to include destructive sampling. Analysis based on root-free bulk soil hydraulic properties indicated substantial redistribution of water via saturated/unsaturated flow and capillary wicking across the layers - suggesting water uptake dynamics following an infiltration event may be more complex than approximated by common soil hydraulic or root surface area modeling approaches. Conclusions: Our results highlight the need for continued exploration of root-trait specific water uptake rates in situ, and impacts of roots on soil hydraulic properties – both critical components for mechanistic modeling of root function.},

abstract = {In Citrus L. sp., specific root length of whole root systems has been correlated positively with root hydraulic conductivity, but there is little mechanistic understanding of the causes for this association. The hydraulic conductivity of individual roots in relation to root anatomical characteristics in seedlings of three citrus rootstocks [sour orange (SO) (Citrus aurantium L.), trifoliate orange (TO) (Poncirus trifoliate (L.) Raf.), and Swingle citrumelo (SC) (C. paradisi Macf. × P. trifoliata)] that vary widely in specific root length (SRL) was measured. Among fibrous roots, first-order and secondorder laterals were examined. Relative differences among rootstocks in the overall hydraulic conductivity (LP) and radial conductivity (LR) for individual 1-month-old and 6-month-old second- and first-order roots generally were consistent with hydraulic conductivity determined previously for entire root systems. There were no significant differences in axial conductance per unit pressure (Kh) in either first- or second-order roots among the rootstocks. This was consistent with the similarity in number and diameter of xylem vessels. One-month-old second-order roots had no suberized exodermis but varied in cortical radius. Six-month-old second-order roots of TO, however, had more nonsuberized cells (passage cells) in the exodermis than roots of SC and SO, although the cortical radius of SC and SO roots were not different. Compared to 6-month-old second-order roots, 1-month-old second-order roots had much higher LP and LR but lower Kh. Differences in overall root hydraulic conductivity among the citrus rootstocks were mainly related to structural differences in the radial pathway for water movement, suggesting that radial hydraulic conductivity was the primary determining factor of water uptake in citrus rootstocks.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Roots play a pivotal role in defining plant ecological success and mediating terrestrial ecosystem functioning. However, roots are difficult to study as they are hidden in the soil matrix and express a plurality of forms and functions: nutrient acquisition, anchorage, nutrient and water transport. Scope In this special issue, we gather 20 articles from emerging topics in root ecology. We specifically focus on five frontiers that are essential to better capture plant, soil and ecosystem processes: (1) root structure and soil resource acquisition; (2) root dynamics; (3) root-root interactions; (4) root-microbe interactions and (5) the effects of roots on soil properties. For each of these sections we provide an overview of our current knowledge, highlight the contributions of this special issue, and pinpoint key remaining challenges for future work. Conclusions Root resource acquisition, root dynamics, root-root and root-microbes interaction and the relative importance of root vs. soil properties on soil aggregation were shown to vary among biomes, soil and climate conditions. Such variability gives a complex but realistic picture of root functioning in real ecosystems and lays an important foundation for future work identify broad patterns of root functioning.},

abstract = {1. A fundamental trade-off among vascular plants between traits inferring rapid resource acquisition and those leading to conservation of resources has now been accepted broadly, but is based on empirical data with a strong bias towards leaf traits. Here, we test whether interspecific variation in traits of different plant organs obeys this same trade-off and whether within-plant trade-offs are consistent between organs. 2. Thereto, we measured suites of the same chemical and structural traits from the main vegetative organs for a species set representing aquatic, riparian and terrestrial environments including the main vascular higher taxa and growth forms of a subarctic flora. The traits were chosen to have consistent relevance for plant defence and growth across organs and environments: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, lignin, dry matter content, pH. 3. Our analysis shows several new trait correlations across leaves, stems and roots and a striking pattern of whole-plant integrative resource economy, leading to tight correspondence between the local leaf economics spectrum and the root (r = 0.64), stem (r = 0.78) and whole-plant (r = 0.93) economics spectra. 4. Synthesis. Our findings strongly suggest that plant resource economics is consistent across species' organs in a subarctic flora. We provide thus the first evidence for a `plant economics spectrum' closely related to the local subarctic `leaf economics spectrum'. Extending that concept to other biomes is, however, necessary before any generalization might be made. In a world facing rapid vegetation change, these results nevertheless bear considerable prospects of predicting below-ground plant functions from the above-ground components alone.},

(1) P content wasn't intercorrelated across all plant organs, despite covarying with N

(3) Findings are constrained within a single spatial scale (local factors are king here; soil depth, biotic factors, succession, microtopography). Would we see the same patterns at a larger scale?

Vegetated or green roofs are one potential remedy for this problem. Establishing plant material on rooftops provides numerous ecological and economic benefits, including stormwater management, energy conservation, mitigation of the urban heat island effect, and increased longevity of roofing membranes, as well as providing a more aesthetically pleasing environment in which to work and live. Furthermore, the construction and maintenance of green roofs provide business opportunities for nurseries, landscape contractors, irrigation specialists, and other green industry members while addressing the issues of environmental stewardship. This paper is a review of current knowledge regarding the benefits of green roofs, plant selection and culture, and barriers to their acceptance in the United States. Because of building weight restrictions and costs, shallow-substrate extensive roofs are much more common than deeper intensive roofs. Therefore, the focus of this review is primarily on extensive green roofs.},

abstract = {Plant diversity loss impairs ecosystem functioning, including important effects on soil. Most studies that have explored plant diversity effects belowground, however, have largely focused on biological processes. As such, our understanding of how plant diversity impacts the soil physical environment remains limited, despite the fundamental role soil physical structure plays in ensuring soil function and ecosystem service provision. Here, in both a glasshouse and a long-term field study, we show that high plant diversity in grassland systems increases soil aggregate stability, a vital structural property of soil, and that root traits play a major role in determining diversity effects. We also reveal that the presence of particular plant species within mixed communities affects an even wider range of soil physical processes, including hydrology and soil strength regimes. Our results indicate that alongside well-documented effects on ecosystem functioning, plant diversity and root traits also benefit essential soil physical properties.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

Mediterranean plants have evolved a number of morphological and physiological adapta- tions that determine their ability to survive and grow, being an effective water uptake and use important factors for drought resistance. In this article, we evaluated interspecific differences in morphology, biomass allocation, and architectural traits and their relationship with water use strategies in seedlings of seven co-occurring Mediterranean species (Anthyllis cytisoides L., Genista scorpius L. DC., Myrtus com- munis L., Pistacia lentiscus L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Spartium junceum L. and Ulex parviflorus Pourr.). The results showed that morphological root features vary among species and they are significantly corre- lated with root hydraulic conductance and leaf gas exchange variables. Species with high specific root length (SRL) showed a low hydraulic conductance per root length (KRRL) but high specific hydraulic conduc- tance (KAs). M. communis and P. lentiscus showed the most contrasting water use patterns with respect to the other species studied.The results are not affected when considering phylogenetic relatedness. Thus, the vari- ability observed in root hydraulic properties and leaf gas exchange suggests important mechanisms for understanding species coexistence in water-limited ecosystems.},

abstract = {Image analyses systems provide a quick determination of various root morphological parameters. Generally, a specific testing procedure should be conducted at the beginning of every measurement process. In this study, the performance of two image analyses programs using different measuring algorithms was compared: a commercial package WinRHIZO and a freeware ROOTEDGE. Roots of field grown cereal crops, wheat (Triticum durumDesf.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), were used. Several types of tests were executed: 1. Comparison of image analyses and manually conducted measurements of root length; 2. Comparison between root length, average diameter and surface area measurements performed with ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO; 3. Tests of root arrangement to assess the importance of random orientation of the scanned roots for accurate measurements; 4. Evaluation of the maximum acceptable scanning density (cm scanned root length per cm2 scanning area). The results suggest that ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO provide fairly correct measurements of root morphological parameters. There were small differences between manually and image analyses measurements of root length, in particular using a transparent light unit for scanning. Ratios of image analyses to manual estimations ranged from 0.95 to 1.03 for different root samples of winter barley. Comparisons of the programs generated almost equal root estimates. Discrepancies between diameter and surface area were slightly higher than between length measurements. The average root diameter was a little overestimated by ROOTEDGE compared to WinRHIZO. The most significant source for these discrepancies presumably was the difference between the fixed threshold for ROOTEDGE and the flexible threshold, automatically optimized for every single image by WinRHIZO. ROOTEDGE and WinRHIZO image analyses showed small sensitivity to root sample orientation. Estimations of root length, average diameter and surface area were well reproducible. For the scanning density to 3 cm cm-2 CV values for the replicated measurements varied between 0.3{\%} and 3.4{\%} by both programs. High scanning density of roots resulted in increasing underestimation of root length and overestimation of root average diameter. For the common scanning density range in root research between 1 and 3 cm cm-2 discrepancies did not exceed 5{\%}. Higher scanning densities than 3 cm cm-2 are not recommended.},

To address this knowledge gap, we synthesized available literature on tundra roots, including their distribution, dynamics and contribution to ecosystem carbon and nutrient fluxes, and highlighted key aspects of their representation in terrestrial biosphere models. Across all tundra ecosystems, belowground plant biomass exceeded aboveground biomass, with the exception of polar desert tundra. Roots were shallowly distributed in the thin layer of soil that thaws annually, and were often found in surface organic soil horizons. Root traits - including distribution, chemistry, anatomy and resource partitioning - play an important role in controlling plant species competition, and therefore ecosystem carbon and nutrient fluxes, under changing climatic conditions, but have only been quantified for a small fraction of tundra plants. Further, the annual production and mortality of fine roots are key components of ecosystem processes in tundra, but extant data are sparse. Tundra root traits and dynamics should be the focus of future research efforts. Better representation of the dynamics and characteristics of tundra roots will improve the utility of models for the evaluation of the responses of tundra ecosystems to changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract: Trees partition rainfall into throughfall and stemflow, resulting in a spatial distribution of nutrient and water fluxes reaching the soil centred on the trunks of trees. Stemflow fluxes of water and nutrients are then funneled preferentially belowground along tree roots and other preferential flow paths, bypassing much of the bulk soil. This double funneling leads to increased soil chemical, biological, and hydrological heterogeneity, which has been shown to persist for decades. In this paper, we review nutrient fluxes of stemflow water for a variety of tree species and climates. The amount of precipitation partitioned by trees to stemflow ranges over more than three orders of magnitude, accounting for 0.07-22{\%} of incident rainfall in a range of precipitation regimes (600-7100 mm.y-i). Stemflow fluxes of NO3- and K were found to be larger for species with greater stemflow partitioning, regardless of climate type. While sternflow volumes may increase in relation to increasing precipitation, stemflow nutrient concentrations tend to become more dilute. On an annual basis, however, it appears that plant canopy morphology is strongly related to stemflow fluxes for plant-mobile nutrients such as K (r2 = 0.64) and NO3- (r2 = 0.61). Root-induced preferential flow provides an additional feedback mechanism in nutrient cycling by which stemflow-derived nutrient fluxes are delivered to the rhizosphere},

abstract = {Algorithms for estimating root length by image analysis should lead to results that have no systematic error (bias), be insensitive to preferential root orientation, valid across a wide range of sample sizes and adjust for overlap between roots in samples, to reduce the effort needed in spreading out root systems. We propose a new algorithm that forms a compromise between small bias and robustness (insensitivity to variation in sample size and preferential root orientation), and provide a simple way of dealing with root overlap. Image analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. The digital image of the root was processed to get the thinned image (skeleton). The numbers of orthogonally and diagonally connected pairs of pixels (No andNd, respectively) in the skeletonwere counted separately and used for length (L) calculation.A new length calculation equation was introduced so that the effect of orientation on length calculation was minimized; L =[Nd2 + (Nd + No/2)2]1/2 + No/2. The maximum error due to orientation of a single line was evaluated for an ideal line, and the analysis revealed that the new equation was less affected by orientation than previous equations. Copper wire and rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots containing both primary and fine secondary root were measured manually andwith image analysis. The two methods showed good agreementwithin 1.5{\%}. The proposed image analysis method yielded length estimates with CV from 0.23 to 0.88{\%}, which was lower than the CVs of the line-intersect method. Moreover, the lengths of overlapping samples were calculated correctly because the image analysis method distinguished an overlapping pixel from a thinned image, while the calculation with the line-intersect method showed underestimation because overlaps were not considered in that method.},

abstract = {1. Root, stem and leaf traits are thought to be functionally coordinated to maximize the efficiency of acquiring and using limited resources. However, evidence is mixed for consistent whole-plant trait coordination among woody plants, and we lack a clear understanding of the adaptive value of root traits along soil resource gradients. If fine roots are the below-ground analogue to leaves, then low specific root length (SRL) and high tissue density should be common on infertile soil. Here, we test the prediction that root, stem and leaf traits and relative growth rate respond in unison with soil fertility gradients. 2. We measured fine root, stem and leaf traits and relative growth rate on individual seedlings of 66 tree species grown in controlled conditions. Our objectives were (i) to determine whether multiple root traits align with growth rate, leaf and stem traits and with each other and (ii) to quantify the relationships between community-weighted mean root traits and two strong soil fertility gradients that differed in spatial extent and community composition. 3. At the species level, fast growth rates were associated with low root and stem tissue density and high specific leaf area. SRL and root diameter were not clearly related to growth rate and loaded on a separate principal component from the plant economic spectrum. 4. At the community level, growth rate was positively related to soil fertility, and root tissue density (RTD) and branching were negatively related to soil fertility. SRL was negatively related and root diameter was positively related to soil fertility on the large-scale gradient that included ectomycor-rhizal angiosperms. 5. Synthesis. Root, stem and leaf tissue traits of tree seedlings are coordinated and influence fitness along soil fertility gradients. RTD responds in unison with above-ground traits to soil fertility gradi-ents; however, root traits are multidimensional because SRL is orthogonal to the plant economic spectrum. In contrast to leaves, trees are not constrained in the way they construct fine roots: plants can construct high or low SRL roots of any tissue density. High RTD is the most consistent below-ground trait that reflects adaptation to infertile soil.},

It is becoming clear that a stronger emphasis on below-ground traits is needed to better predict future changes in plant biodiversity and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. Here I propose six 'below-ground frontiers' in trait-based plant ecology, with an emphasis on traits governing soil nutrient acquisition: redefining fine roots; quantifying root trait dimensionality; integrating mycorrhizas; broadening the suite of root traits; determining linkages between root traits and abiotic and biotic factors; and understanding ecosystem-level consequences of root traits. Focusing research efforts along these frontiers should help to fulfil the promise of trait-based ecology: enhanced predictive capacity across ecological scales.},

However, water manipulation and root measurements are rarely coupled empirically across growth forms to identify whether belowground strategies are generalizable across species. ? We measured seedling root traits across three moisture levels in 18 Mediterranean forbs, grasses, and woody species. ? Drought increased the root mass fraction (RMF) and decreased the relative proportion of thin roots (indicated by increased root diameters and decreased specific root length (SRL)), rates of root elongation and growth, plant nitrogen uptake, and plant growth. Although responses varied across species, plasticity was not associated with growth form. Woody species differed from forbs and grasses in many traits, but herbaceous groups were similar. Across water treatments, trait correlations suggested a single spectrum of belowground trade-offs related to resource acquisition and plant growth. While effects of SRL and RMF on plant growth shifted with drought, root elongation rate consistently represented this spec- trum. ? We demonstrate that general patterns of root morphology and plasticity are identifiable across diverse species. Root trait measurements should enhance our understanding of below- ground strategy and performance across growth forms, but it will be critical to incorporate plasticity and additional aspects of root function into these efforts.},

abstract = {A large-scale laboratory study was conducted to test the influence of design and operating conditions on the lifespan of stormwater biofilters. The evolution of hydraulic conductivity over time was studied in relation to a number of key design parameters (media type, filter depth, vegetation type, system sizing, etc). The biofilters were observed to clog over time, with average hydraulic conductivity decreasing by a factor of 3.6 over the 72 weeks of testing. The choice of plant species appears to have a significant effect on the rate of decrease in permeability, with plants with thick roots (e.g. Melaleuca) demonstrating an ability to maintain permeability over time. Other species studied, with finer roots, had no such beneficial effects. As expected, small systems relative to their catchment (and thus which are subjected to high loading rates) are more prone to clogging, as increases in hydraulic and sediment loading can lead to extremely low hydraulic conductivities. Sizing and the appropriate choice of vegetation are thus key elements in design because they can limit clogging, and therefore, indirectly increase annual load treated by limiting the volume of water bypassing the system. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

Here, we tested the relationship between leaf economics traits, including leaf nitrogen con- centration and leaf dry mass per area, and leaf hydraulic traits including stomatal density and vein density in five tropical-subtropical forests. Surprisingly, these two suites of traits were statisti- cally decoupled. This decoupling suggests that independent trait dimensions exist within a leaf, with leaf economics dimension corresponding to light capture and tissue longevity, and the hydraulic dimension to water-use and leaf temperature maintenance. Clearly, leaf economics and hydraulic traits can vary independently, thus allowing for more possible plant trait combinations. Compared with a single trait dimension, multiple trait dimensions may better enable species adap- tations to multifarious niche dimensions, promote diverse plant strategies and facilitate species coexistence.},

abstract = {Earlier studies have reported that deeper substrate promoted coverage and survival of plants in extensive green roofs. However, little is known about the influence of substrate depths on the distribution of roots and the physiological response of green roof plant to severe drought stress. Two controlled experiments using simulated green roof were conducted with the objective of evaluating the effects of substrate depth on growth, morphology and drought tolerance of Sedum lineare. It was found that plants grown in shallower substrate (4. cm) had better biomass accumulation and bigger root size (total length, surface area, volume and number of tips). This was likely because shallower substrate allowed more roots to distribute into the drainage layer with a reservoir where extra water can be stored under sufficient water supply. Under persistent drought stress, however, shallower substrate led to poor performance of the plants. With the addition of a 5-week continuous drought treatment, plants under the 4. cm depth substrate treatment displayed lower relative water content, root dehydrogenase activity and higher malondialdehyde (MDA) content than plants under the 10. cm depth substrate treatment by the end of the drought period. Therefore, if green roof is established with a drainage layer that could store water and is provided with moderate supplemental water, shallower substrate can be used to improve biomass accumulation and promote initial plant growth. If the water supply is restricted, however, deeper substrate is recommended to ensure better drought tolerance performance of plants in extensive green roof.},

abstract = {The presence of drought tolerant vegetation is essential for the longevity of an extensive green roof when irrigation is not installed. Earlier studies have examined performance of green roof plants under contrasting watering regimes and found that higher watering frequency provided better growth and survival rates. The effect of early watering regimes on the subsequent response of plants to persistent drought stress in extensive green roofs, however, has not been extensively studied. In order to evaluate the effects of watering regime during the establishment period of Sedum lineare on its growth and drought tolerance, two greenhouse experiments using simulated green roofs were conducted. It was found in the first experiment that a 2-day-interval watering regimen at the early planting stage produced greater root biomass and root size than those of 6-day- and 13-day-interval watering, indicating that deficit watering tended to induce thinner roots in S. lineare. In the second experiment, the remaining plants were subsequently subjected to a 28-day drought treatment. The roots of plants watered at 13-day-interval maintained the highest respiration activity among all plants during the drought period. Results suggest that an appropriate deficit watering regimen at the early planting stage may lead to smaller root size and higher root:shoot ratios in S. lineare, and thereby improve its drought tolerance performance on extensive green roofs.},

abstract = {Constructed ecosystems such as green roofs often contain monocultures or low-diversity plant communities, but adding more plant species to these systems can increase ecosystem service provisioning. Mixture advantage, when species-rich treatments outperform the best monocultures, is desirable in constructed ecosystems due to the cost of increasing diversity. However, there have not been any studies in constructed ecosystems that have quantitatively compared mixtures with the best monocultures for multifunctionality, and there have been few studies that have examined how provision of ecosystem services changes over time as plant communities develop. In a green roof system, I predicted (i) that the mixture advantage would be stronger for ecosystem multifunctionality than for single ecosystem functions and (ii) that ecosystem service provisioning and complementarity in above-ground biomass would increase over time. Fifteen monocultures of plant species from five life-form groups (succulents, tall forbs, dwarf shrubs, creeping forbs, grasses) were compared with three-species mixtures of the same life-form and mixtures of species from three and five different life-forms in a modular green roof system. Indicators of ecosystem services including above-ground production, thermal regulation, stormwater retention, nutrient uptake and carbon sequestration and two indices of ecosystem multifunctionality were compared. Canopy density increased over time while substrate temperature decreased, suggesting higher provisioning of valuable ecosystem services. For single services, the positive relationship between planted species richness and ecosystem service grew stronger over time, but was consistently strong over time for multifunctionality. Quantile regression indicated a weak mixture advantage for several services including both multifunctionality indices. While the effects were small, different species optimized different functions, thus multifunctioning is enhanced in more diverse mixtures by combining species that maximize different functions. Tripartite partitioning of canopy density showed that overyielding and trait-independent complementarity fluctuated between years in response to shifts in species abundances, but dominance and trait-dependent complementarity increased over time. Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first evidence in a constructed ecosystem that mixtures can outperform the best monocultures for multiple ecosystem services. Mixtures of plant life-forms can improve green roof performance. The biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships observed in natural ecosystems can also occur in novel and highly simplified engineered ecosystems.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Green roofs perform ecosystem services such as summer roof temperature reduction and stormwater capture that directly contribute to lower building energy use and potential economic savings. These services are in turn related to ecosystem functions performed by the vegetation layer such as radiation reflection and transpiration, but little work has examined the role of plant species composition and diversity in improving these functions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a replicated modular extensive (shallow growing- medium) green roof system planted with monocultures or mixtures containing one, three or five life-forms, to quantify two ecosystem services: summer roof cooling and water capture. We also measured the related ecosystem properties/processes of albedo, evapotranspiration, and the mean and temporal variability of aboveground biomass over four months. Mixtures containing three or five life-form groups, simultaneously optimized several green roof ecosystem functions, outperforming monocultures and single life-form groups, but there was much variation in performance depending on which life-forms were present in the three life-form mixtures. Some mixtures outperformed the best monocultures for water capture, evapotranspiration, and an index combining both water capture and temperature reductions. Combinations of tall forbs, grasses and succulents simultaneously optimized a range of ecosystem performance measures, thus the main benefit of including all three groups was not to maximize any single process but to perform a variety of functions well.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ecosystem services from green roofs can be improved by planting certain life-form groups in combination, directly contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. The strong performance by certain mixtures of life-forms, especially tall forbs, grasses and succulents, warrants further investigation into niche complementarity or facilitation as mechanisms governing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in green roof ecosystems.},

Ecologists use plant species traits as generic predictors of geographical distribution, interactions with other species, and ecosystem functioning, but this approach has been little used to optimize engineered ecosystems. Four plant species traits (height, individual leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) were evaluated as predictors of ecosystem properties and services in a modular green roof system planted with 21 species. Six indicators of ecosystem services, incorporating thermal, hydrological, water quality, and carbon sequestration functions, were predicted by the four plant traits directly or indirectly via their effects on aggregate ecosystem properties, including canopy density and albedo. Species average height and specific leaf area were the most useful traits, predicting several services via effects on canopy density or growth rate. This study demonstrates that easily measured plant traits can be used to select species to optimize green roof performance across multiple key services.},

abstract = {Plant roots have greatly diversified in form and function since the emergence of the first land plants, but the global organization of functional traits in roots remains poorly understood. Here we analyse a global dataset of 10 functionally important root traits in metabolically active first-order roots, collected from 369 species distributed across the natural plant communities of 7 biomes. Our results identify a high degree of organization of root traits across species and biomes, and reveal a pattern that differs from expectations based on previous studies of leaf traits. Root diameter exerts the strongest influence on root trait variation across plant species, growth forms and biomes. Our analysis suggests that plants have evolved thinner roots since they first emerged in land ecosystems, which has enabled them to markedly improve their efficiency of soil exploration per unit of carbon invested and to reduce their dependence on symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. We also found that diversity in root morphological traits is greatest in the tropics, where plant diversity is highest and many ancestral phylogenetic groups are preserved. Diversity in root morphology declines sharply across the sequence of tropical, temperate and desert biomes, presumably owing to changes in resource supply caused by seasonally inhospitable abiotic conditions. Our results suggest that root traits have evolved along a spectrum bounded by two contrasting strategies of root life: an ancestral ‘conservative' strategy in which plants with thick roots depend on symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi for soil resources and a more-derived ‘opportunistic' strategy in which thin roots enable plants to more efficiently leverage photosynthetic carbon for soil exploration. These findings imply that innovations of belowground traits have had an important role in preparing plants to colonize new habitats, and in generating biodiversity within and across biomes.},

Estimates of carbon and nutrient allocation to build and maintain these structures remain uncertain because of the challenges of consistently measuring and interpreting fine-root systems. Traditionally, fine roots have been defined as all roots ≤ 2 mm in diameter, yet it is now recognized that this approach fails to capture the diversity of form and function observed among fine-root orders. Here, we demonstrate how order-based and functional classification frameworks improve our understanding of dynamic root processes in ecosystems dominated by perennial plants. In these frameworks, fine roots are either separated into individual root orders or functionally defined into a shorter-lived absorptive pool and a longer-lived transport fine-root pool. Using these frameworks, we estimate that fine-root production and turnover represent 22{\%} of terrestrial net primary production globally – a c. 30{\%} reduction from previous estimates assuming a single fine-root pool. Future work developing tools to rapidly differentiate functional fine-root classes, explicit incorporation of mycorrhizal fungi into fine-root studies, and wider adoption of a two-pool approach to model fine roots provide opportunities to better understand below-ground processes in the terrestrial biosphere.},

abstract = {In urban environments, green roofs provide a number of benefits, including decreased urban heat island effects and reduced energy costs for buildings. However, little research has been done on the non-plant biota associated with green roofs, which likely affect their functionality. For the current study, we evaluated whether or not green roofs planted with two native plant communities in New York City functioned as habitats for soil fungal communities, and compared fungal communities in green roof growing media to soil microbial composition in five city parks, including Central Park and the High Line. Ten replicate roofs were sampled one year after planting; three of these roofs were more intensively sampled and compared to nearby city parks. Using Illumina sequencing of the fungal ITS region we found that green roofs supported a diverse fungal community, with numerous taxa belonging to fungal groups capable of surviving in disturbed and polluted habitats. Across roofs, there was significant biogeographical clustering of fungal communities, indicating that community assembly of roof microbes across the greater New York City area is locally variable. Green roof fungal communities were compositionally distinct from city parks and only 54{\%} of the green roof taxa were also found in the park soils. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis revealed that park soils had greater microbial biomass and higher bacterial to fungal ratios than green roof substrates. City park soils were also more enriched with heavy metals, had lower pH, and lower quantities of total bases (Ca, K, and Mg) compared to green roof substrates. While fungal communities were compositionally distinct across green roofs, they did not differentiate by plant community. Together, these results suggest that fungi living in the growing medium of green roofs may be an underestimated component of these biotic systems functioning to support some of the valued ecological services of green roofs.},

This paper analyzes the original measurements reported in 18 publications. Rainfall-runoff relationships for an annual and seasonal time scale were obtained from the analysis of the available 628 data records. The derived empirical models allowed us to assess the surface runoff from various types of roofs, when roof characteristics and the annual or seasonal precipitation are given. The annual rainfall-runoff relationship for green roofs is strongly determined by the depth of the substrate layer. The retention of rainwater on green roofs is lower in winter than in summer. The application of the derived annual relationship for the region of Brussels showed that extensive roof greening on just 10{\%} of the buildings would already results in a runoff reduction of 2.7{\%} for the region and of 54{\%} for the individual buildings. Green roofs can therefore be a useful tool for reducing urban rainfall runoff. Yet in order to provide a greater effect on overall runoff they should be accompanied by other means of runoff reduction and/or water retention. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ecological engineering is defined as "the design of sustainable ecosystems that integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both." It involves the restoration of ecosystems that have been substantially disturbed by human activities such as environmental pollution or land disturbance; and the development of new sustainable ecosystems that have both human and ecological value. While there was some early discussion of ecological engineering in the 1960s, its development was spawned later by several factors, including loss of confidence in the view that all pollution problems can be solved through technological means and the realization that with technological means, pollutants are just being moved from one form to another. Conventional approaches require massive amounts of resources to solve these problems, and that in turn perpetuates carbon and nitrogen cycle problems, for example. The development of ecological engineering was given strong impetus in the last decade with a textbook, the journal Ecological Engineering and two professional ecological engineering societies. Five principles about ecological engineering are: (1) It is based on the self-designing capacity of ecosystems; (2) It can be the acid test of ecological theories; (3) It relies on system approaches; (4) It conserves non-renewable energy sources; and (5) It supports biological conservation. Ecology as a science is not routinely integrated into engineering curricula, even in environmental engineering programs, while shortcoming, ecologists, environmental scientists, and managers miss important training in their profession - problem solving. These two problems could be solved in the integrated field of ecological engineering. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This provides enormous potential for designing nature-based stormwater treatment technologies, such as biofiltration systems.

Currently, there is a lack of information on how to efficiently select from the vast palette of species. This study aimed to identify plant traits beneficial to performance and create a decision-support tool to screen species for further testing. A laboratory experiment using 220 biofilter columns paired plant morphological characteristics with nitrogen removal and water loss for 20 Australian native species and two lawn grasses. Testing was undertaken during wet and dry conditions, for two biofilter designs (saturated zone and free-draining). An extensive root system and high total biomass were critical to the effective removal of total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (NO3−), driven by high nitrogen assimilation. The same characteristics were key to performance under dry conditions, and were associated with high water use for Australian native plants; linking assimilation and transpiration. The decision-support tool uses these scientific relationships and readily-available information to identify the morphology, natural distribution and stress tolerances likely to be good predictors of plant nitrogen and water uptake.},

abstract = {In this paper, we have reviewed how the hydraulic design of trees influences the movement of water from roots to leaves. The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

abstract = {Plant species composition and community functional structure (i.e. trait composition at the community level) result from a hierarchy of environmental filters that constrain which species and traits tend to be dominant in a given habitat. We quantified variation in community functional structure along natural gradients of soil resources using several above- and below-ground parameters and explored links among these attributes to determine whether plant resource economics can be applied at the community level in a Mediterranean rangeland of southern France. Limitation by nitrogen, soil water and soil depth were the main ecological factors driving the functional response at the community level. Most of the community functional parameters considered in this study were more dependent on nitrogen limitation than on the other two factors, mostly related with the acquisitionconservation trade-off at both the leaf and the root level. We found a strong coordination between above-ground and below-ground components, with a high level of concordance along the resource gradients explored. As an example, tissue dry matter content both in leaves and roots was positively related to nitrogen limitation. These findings indicate that the leaf economic spectrum paradigm (resource conservation in resource-poor habitats versus resource acquisition in resource-rich habitats) can be extrapolated to the below-ground component and extends to a plant community spectrum. Changes in the functional structure of communities were promoted by two complementary components of variation: (i) the replacement of species with highly contrasting resource-use strategies and, to a lesser extent, (ii) the intraspecific variation in several above-ground traits. Synthesis. This study showed that soil water and nutrient limitations are the main drivers controlling functional community structure in the Mediterranean rangelands studied and that shifts in this structure were mainly due to species turnover. In addition, we provided evidence for a plant community economics spectrum, based on a strong coordination between above- and below-ground components in these resource-limited communities.},

abstract = {Background and aims  This paper provides an overview of the measuring capabilities of IJ{\_}Rhizo, an ImageJ macro that measures scanned images of washed root samples. IJ{\_}Rhizo is open-source, platform-independent and offers a simple graphic user interface (GUI) for a main audience of non-programmer scientists. Being open-source based, it is also fully modifiable to accommodate the specific needs of the more computer-literate users. A comparison of IJ{\_}Rhizo's performance with that of the widely used commercial package WinRHIZO™ is discussed. Methods  We compared IJ{\_}Rhizo's performance with that of the commercial package WinRHIZO™ using two sets of images, one comprising test-line images, the second consisting of images of root samples collected in the field. IJ{\_}Rhizo and WinRHIZO™ estimates were compared by means of correlation and regression analysis. Results  IJ{\_}Rhizo “Kimura” and WinRHIZO™ “Tennant” were the length estimates that were best linearly correlated with each other. Correlation between average root diameter estimates was weaker, due to the sensitivity of this parameter to thresholding and filtering of image background noise. Conclusions  Overall, IJ{\_}Rhizo offers new opportunities for researchers who cannot afford the cost of commercial software packages to carry out automated measurement of scanned images of root samples, without sacrificing accuracy.},

The carbon content of whole plants was lower for fast-growing species than for slow-growing ones. Fast-growing species accumulated more organic N-compounds, organic acids and minerals, whereas slow-growing species accumulated more (hemi)cellulose, insoluble sugars and lignin. No correlations with relative growth rate were found for soluble phenolics, soluble sugars and lipids. The costs to construct 1 g of plant biomass were rather similar for fast- and slow-growing species, both when expressed as C needed for C-skeletons, as glucose to provide ATP and NAD(P)H, and as total glucose costs. Therefore, we conclude that, despite the differences in chemical composition between fast- and slow-growing species, variation in the costs of synthesis of whole plant biomass cannot explain interspecific variation in relative growth rate of herbaceous species.},

The aim of many such experiments is to compare the phenotype of different species or genotypes in a specific environment, or to study plant performance under a range of suboptimal conditions. Our paper aims to bring together the minimum knowledge necessary for a plant biologist to set up such experiments and apply the environmental conditions that are appropriate to answer the questions of interest. We first focus on the basic choices that have to be made with regard to the experimental setup (e.g. where are the plants grown; what rooting medium; what pot size). Second, we present practical considerations concerning the number of plants that have to be analysed considering the variability in plant material and the required precision. Third, we discuss eight of the most important environmental factors for plant growth (light quantity, light quality, CO2, nutrients, air humidity, water, temperature and salinity); what critical issues should be taken into account to ensure proper growth conditions in controlled environments and which specific aspects need attention if plants are challenged with a certain a-biotic stress factor. Finally, we propose a simple checklist that could be used for tracking and reporting experimental conditions.},

Various methodological tools exist to analyze the resulting allocation patterns, based either on the calculation of biomass ratios or fractions of different organs at a given point in time, or on a so-called allometric analysis of biomass data sampled across species or over an experimental growth period. We discuss the weak and strong points of each of these methods. Although both approaches have useful features, we suggest that often a plot of biomass fractions against total plant size, either across species or in the comparison of treatment effects, combines the best of both worlds.},

abstract = {The mechanisms controlling the genesis of rhizosheaths are not well understood, despite their importance in controlling the flux of nutrients and water from soil to root. Here, we examine the development of rhizosheaths from drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive chickpea varieties; focusing on the three-dimensional characterization of the pore volume ({\textgreater} 16 lm voxel spatial resolution) obtained from X-ray microtomography, along with the characterization of mucilage and root hairs, and water sorption. We observe that drought-tolerant plants generate a larger diameter root, and a greater and more porous mass of rhizosheath, which also has a significantly increased water sorptivity, as compared with bulk soil. Using lattice Boltzmann simulations of soil permeability, we find that the root activity of both cultivars creates an anisotropic structure in the rhizosphere, in that its ability to conduct water in the radial direction is significantly higher than in the axial direction, especially in the drought-tolerant cultivar. We suggest that significant differences in rhizosheath architectures are sourced not only by changes in structure of the volumes, but also from root mucilage, and further suggest that breeding for rhizosheath architectures and function may be a potential future avenue for better designing crops in a changing environment.},

abstract = {*$\backslash$nThe leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nEvidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nThere are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$n*$\backslash$nEconomic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms.

abstract = {Previous research suggested that the hydraulic properties of root systems of intact plants could be described by two parameters: the hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) or the slope of the flow-density/water potential gradient relationship, and the offset or minimum water potential gradient required to induce flow. In this study, Lpr and offset were correlated with anatomical features of the root radial path in plants with contrasting root anatomy. Two woody and three herbaceous species were examined which exhibit a range of root anatomical features: Asparagus densiflorus (Kunth) Jessop (asparagus), Dendrobium superbum Rchb. f. (dendrobium), Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean), Prunus persica (L.) Batsch. (peach), Citrus aurantium L. (sour orange). Lpr varied about 8-fold, and the offset varied about 6-fold among the five species. Lpr was inversely related to root diameter (r2=0.39) and cortex width (r2=0.55), suggesting that species with thinner roots or roots with a thin cortex had the highest Lpr. Further observations suggested that the cortex width was a stronger determinant of Lpr than root diameter. However, the offset was not correlated with root diameter, stele diameter or cortex width, but was {\textgreater}2-fold higher in species having an exodermis in the root radial path (sour orange, asparagus, and dendrobium) compared to those lacking an exodermis (peach and soybean). The data of root Lpr obtained were similar to those given in the literature for both intact plants and excised roots which have been measured with different techniques. It is concluded that Lpr and offset, which describe the flow-water potential relationship for intact root systems, are related to differences in the root cortex; specifically, its thickness and the presence/absence of a suberized exodermis. Hence, these anatomical differences may, in part, cause the variability in root hydraulic properties that exists among plant species.},

abstract = {Plant functional traits may explain the positive relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning, but species-level trait variation in response to growth conditions is often ignored in trait-based predictions of community performance. In a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment), we measured traits on plants grown as solitary individuals, in monocultures or in mixtures. We calculated two measures of community-level trait composition, i.e. community-weighted mean traits (CWM) and trait diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy; FD) based on different contexts in which traits were measured (trait origins). CWM and FD values of the different measurement origins were then compared regarding their power to predict community biomass production and biodiversity effects quantified with the additive partitioning method. Irrespective of trait origin, models combining CWM and FD values as predictors best explained community biomass and biodiversity effects. CWM values based on monoculture, mixture-mean or community-specific trait data were similarly powerful predictors, but predictions became worse when trait values originated from solitary-grown individuals. FD values based on monoculture traits were the best predictors of community biomass and net biodiversity effects, while FD values based on community-specific traits were the best predictors for complementarity and selection effects. Traits chosen as best CWM predictors were not strongly affected by trait origin but traits chosen as best FD predictors varied strongly dependent on trait origin and altered the predictability of community performance. We conclude that by adjusting their functional traits to species richness and even specific community compositions, plants can change community-level trait compositions, thereby also changing community biomass production and biodiversity effects. Incorporation of these plastic trait adjustments of plants in trait-based ecology can improve its predictive power in explaining biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships.

abstract = {Specific root length (SRL) and root tissue density (RTD) are ecologically functional traits which are calculated from root length or volume and root dry weight. Both can be converted into each other using the root diameter assuming roots are cylindrical. The calculation of volume from length or length from volume is, however, problematic because samples of roots do usually not have a constant diameter. Ignorance of the diameter heterogeneity leads to an overestimation of length and an underestimation of volume if standard formulas are used. Here I show for two datasets that SRL and RTD are overestimated on average 67{\%} for the two analyzed datasets, but up to 150{\%}, if calculated from each other. I further highlight that the volume values for the total sample as provided by the commonly used software WinRHIZO(TM) should only be used for objects with constant diameter. I recommend to use volume values provided for each diameter class of a sample if WinRHIZO(TM) is used. If manual methods, like the line-intersect method, are used, roots should be separated into diameter classes before length measurements if the volume is calculated from length. Trait to trait conversions for whole samples are not recommended.},

abstract = {Root length has a touch of mystery to it, reflecting the difficulty in extracting fine roots from the soil, and the enormous length these roots can attain. For example, Dittmer (1937) excavated the entire root system of a single rye plant, which consisted of 13,815,672 branches and had a total length of 622 km with a surface area of 237 m 2 , and a total root hair length of 11,000 km. Since then, progress has been made in the methodology of assessing root length and in understanding the variation in it, but there still remains an air of mystery around root length as even the newest findings are often contradictory. Investigations have often focused on Specific Root Length (SRL), a trait which characterizes the economical aspects of a root system, stating the costs––mass––per potential return––root length. SRL has been shown to increase, decrease, or stay constant in response to nutrient limitation (Ryser 1998). Further-more, root length does not always respond to specific ions, such as nitrate or phosphate, in manner like theories based on the mobility of these ions would predict (Robinson 1996; Leyser and Fitter 1998). In this issue, Hill et al. (2006) describe an ele-gant experiment to tackle this mystery. They investigate the variation in specific root length and root surface area in response to variation in N and P supply among 10 temperate pasture species with contrasting root morphologies and contrast-ing N and P requirements. They investigate the traits contributing to variation in root surface area: biomass allocation to roots, SRL, root fineness and tissue mass density. The results show that the root morphology of a species indeed corresponds well with its phosphorus require-ments. The data also clearly illustrate the general importance of phenotypic plasticity for the maintenance of resource acquisition capacity at low levels of the resource, as all species were able to maintain a fairly constant root length across a wide range of P treatments, despite a large vari-ation in total plant mass and root mass. However, the degree of the plastic response was not related to the P uptake capacity of the species, and the patterns cannot readily be generalized. In response to P limitation, some species changed their biomass allocation pattern, some changed root fineness, and others root tissue mass density. There was no consistent relationship in the nutrient level at which the species began to modify their root characteristics and their nutri-ent requirement.},

abstract = {* Despite the fundamental significance of water to plants and the persisting question of how competing species coexist, this is the first review of hydrological niches. We define hydrological niche segregation (HNS) as: (i) partitioning of space on fine-scale soil-moisture gradients, (ii) partitioning of water as a resource and/or (iii) partitioning of recruitment opportunities among years caused by species specializing on particular patterns of temporal variance of water supply (the storage effect). * We propose that there are three types of constraint that lead to the trade-offs that underlie HNS. (i) An edaphic constraint creates a trade-off between the supply to roots of O2 on the one hand vs. water and nutrients on the other. (ii) A biophysical constraint governs gas exchange by leaves, leading to a trade-off between CO2 acquisition vs. water loss. (iii) A structural constraint arising from the physics of water-conducting tissues leads to a safety vs. efficiency trade-off. * Significant HNS was found in 43 of 48 field studies across vegetation types ranging from arid to wet, though its role in coexistence remains to be proven in most cases. Temporal partitioning promotes coexistence through the storage effect in arid plant communities, but has yet to be shown elsewhere. In only a few cases is it possible to unequivocally link HNS to a particular trade-off. * Synthesis. The field and experimental evidence make it clear that HNS is widespread, though it is less clear what its precise mechanisms or consequences are. HNS mechanisms should be revealed by further study of the constraints and trade-offs that govern how plants obtain and use water, and HNS can be mechanistically linked to its consequences with appropriate community models. In a changing climate, such an integrated programme would pay dividends for global change research.},

abstract = {Root morphological response to experimentally induced soil heterogeneity is reported here on three grassland species (Luzula campestris, Poa angustifolia and Plantago lanceolata) under field conditions. Nutrient application was combined with suppression of mycorrhizal infection and with substrate structure modification in experimental patches. For each isolated root, we determined five dimensional characteristics and two topological parameters, including a newly introduced topological index (dichotomous branching index). Nonmycorrhizal L. campestris responded little to nutrient application, but strongly to benomyl application, in all characteristics measured. Mycorrhizal P. angustifolia produced the longest, most branched roots but exhibited limited sensitivity to nutrients and benomyl application. Strongly mycorrhizal P. lanceolata was the most sensitive to nutrient application, but showed little response to benomyl application. It was the only one among the species studied with root characteristics influenced (negatively) by increased production of total root biomass in the patches. Substrate structure influenced dimensional characteristics of Poa and Luzula roots, but not the topological indices. Results indicate different exploitation of soil microsites by L. campestris, P. angustifolia and P. lanceolata. Root topology seems to play a limited role in this process.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. Crop coefficients (k c ) were calculated for three different species of common green roof succulents from March to November in 2011, to parameterize the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Penman-Monteith equation for use in a mechanistic green roof water-balance model. Seasonally averaged k c values for each species for 2011 were used to predict plant evapotranspiration (E T ) in 2012. The adjusted FAO Penman-Monteith equation predicted the total annual E T within 3-13 mm, a substantial improvement over model predictions with k c set to 1, which overpredicted E T by 100 mm or more, depending on the species. The adjusted equation was inserted in water-balance models, which predicted runoff within 2-13{\%} of measured totals for 2012. This discrepancy may be explained by variability in maximum water-holding capacity, which is difficult for two-dimensional models to predict. Nevertheless, these results provide increased confidence in the use of models to predict stormwater runoff from green roofs, and evaluate performance. Monitoring multiple green roof installations with cost-effective sensor networks will increase the ability to identify the key components to enhance green roof function, reduce stormwater runoff, and inform future design.},

abstract = {Green roofs are increasingly being used among the suite of tools designed to reduce the volume of surface water runoff generated by cities. Plants provide the primary mechanism for restoring the rainfall retention capacity of green roofs, but selecting plants with high water use is likely to increase drought stress. Using empirically-derived plant physiological parameters, we used a water balance model to assess the trade-off between rainfall retention and plant drought stress under a 30-year climate scenario. We compared high and low water users with either drought avoidance or drought tolerance strategies. Green roofs with low water-using, drought-avoiding species achieved high rainfall retention (66–81{\%}) without experiencing significant drought stress. Roofs planted with other strategies showed high retention (72–90{\%}), but they also experienced {\textgreater} 50 days of drought stress per year. However, not all species with the same strategy behaved similarly, therefore selecting plants based on water use and drought strategy alone does not guarantee survival in shallow substrates where drought stress can develop quickly. Despite this, it is more likely that green roofs will achieve high rainfall retention with minimal supplementary irrigation if planted with low water users with drought avoidance strategies.},

abstract = {1. Plant functional traits have revealed trade-offs related to life-history adaptations, geographi-cal distributions, and ecosystem processes. Fine roots are essential in plant resource acquisition and play an important role in soil carbon cycling. Nonetheless, root trait variation is still poorly quantified and rarely related to the rest of the plant. 2. We examined chemical and morphological traits of 34 temperate arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species, representing three main angiosperm clades (super-orders asterid, magnoliid and rosid). We tested to what extent fine root chemical and morphological traits were correlated similarly to the leaf economical spectrum (LES) or were structured by ancestral affiliations among species. 3. Root traits did not display the same trade-offs as leaves (e.g. specific root length was not cor-related with root N, whereas specific leaf area was correlated with leaf N). Moreover, 75{\%} of below-ground traits were phylogenetically structured according to Pagel's k and Abouheif's C mean autocorrelation tests, as opposed to 28{\%} of above-ground traits. Magnoliids showed thicker, less branched roots than asterids or rosids, but rosid roots exhibited lower N and higher non-acid-hydrolysable (e.g. lignin) content than other species. In contrast, leaf traits did not dif-fer significantly among super-orders. At the whole-tree level, chemical traits such as nitrogen tis-sue content and lignin content were correlated between above and below-ground organs. 4. The distribution of root traits in woody temperate trees was better explained by shared ancestry than by the nutrient content and structural trade-offs expected by the LES hypothesis. Root chemistry and morphology differed substantially among species belonging to different super-orders, suggesting deep divergences in resource acquisition strategies among major angiosperm groups. Although we found partial support for the idea of whole-plant integration based on corresponding nitrogen content across all organs (i.e. a plant economics spectrum), our study stresses phylogenetic affiliation as the primary driver of root trait distributions among angiosperms, a pattern that could be easily overlooked based solely on above-ground observations.},

At the species level, diameter-related traits were mainly restricted by phylogenetic structure and showed little plasticity to the changing environments, whereas the variation in woody root nutrient was influenced significantly by soil variables. For community-level traits, the diameter-related axis scores of principal component analysis (PCA) were mainly driven by mean annual temperature (MAT) through shifting species composition, whereas the root nutrient-related axis scores were strongly influenced by soil P availability. 4.From both species and community levels, our study confirms, that the root-thickness-related dimension and root nutrient dimension represent new support for the multidimensionality of root traits which are driven by different selection pressure. This study also underlines that the community-aggregated traits might serve as a promising avenue to improve our understanding of community assemblage processes, allowing us to predict changes of vegetation distributions in a changing climate.},

abstract = {Green roofs are increasingly being considered a promising engineered ecosystem for reducing stormwater runoff. Plants are a critical component of green roofs and it has been suggested that plants with high water use after rainfall, but which are also drought tolerant, can improve rainfall retention on green roofs. However, there is little evidence to show how plants with different water use strategies will affect green roof retention performance, either in monocultures or in mixed plantings. This study tested how monocultures and a mixture of herbaceous species (Dianella admixta, Lomandra longifolia and Stypandra glauca) affected rainfall retention on green roofs. These species were chosen based on their water use strategies and compared with a commonly used succulent species (Sedum pachyphyllum) with conservative water use. We measured retention performance for 67 rainfall events, quantifying all components of the water balance. We also compared growth for species in monocultures and mixtures. We found that monocultures of L. longifolia had the greatest stormwater retention and ET. Although S. glauca has a similar water use strategy to D. admixta, it had the lowest stormwater retention and ET. In both the mixture and as a monoculture, S. glauca created preferential flow pathways, resulting in lower substrate water contents which reduced ET and therefore rainfall retention. This species also dominated performance of the mixture, such that the mixture had lower ET and retention than all monocultures (except S. glauca). We suggest that root traits and their interaction with substrates should be considered alongside water use strategies for rainfall retention on green roofs.},

@article{Zhou2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 British Ecological Society. Characterizing patterns of variation in plant traits across species and environmental gradients is critical for understanding performance of species in ecosystems. One-dimensional pattern of variation has been demonstrated in leaf traits, which is known as the leaf economic spectrum. However, it is unclear whether such a spectrum exists for root traits. For roots of 15 species from temperate grasslands, we determined respiration rate, relative growth rate, life span and 10 morphological, chemical and anatomical root traits. We further evaluated pairwise and multiple-trait relationships by Pearson's correlation and principle component analysis including phylogenetic contrasts. We found that root functions were related to three clusters of variation. Root respiration rate and relative growth rate were positively correlated with average root diameter (AD), but they were negatively correlated with specific root length (SRL). In contrast, root life span was not correlated with AD, but it was positively correlated with SRL. These results are inconsistent with the presumption of the root economic spectrum. The principle components analysis revealed a multi-dimensional pattern of variation in root traits among the 15 coexisting herbaceous species. Moreover, species within the same phylogenetic clades tended to have similar root trait syndromes. Most of the root traits exhibited a significant phylogenetic signal. Synthesis. Our results do not support a one-dimensional root economic spectrum in the coexisting herbaceous species of temperate grasslands. In contrast, the pattern of variation in root traits was multi-dimensional. We further demonstrated that species in different phylogenetic clades possess diverse root trait syndromes for efficient resource acquisition. Our findings provide a next step in understanding root functions and plant strategies in temperate grasslands.},
