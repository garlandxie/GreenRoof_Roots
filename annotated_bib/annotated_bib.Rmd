# Green Roofs
[@Lundholm2015:2] Lundholm et al. 2015. Env Sci Tech

- plant functional can be used to streamline plant selection for green roof ecosystems
collected only leaf and canopy traits (e.g. SLA, LDMC, height and leaf area) that are known for driving productivity and resource uptake
- managed to find some links between plant traits and green roof ecosystem services using a model-averaging approach
- some interesting findings were:
  - stormwater capture rate: shrubs had the highest performance, followed by grasses and succulents
  - substrate cooling: large variation among the grasses and shrubs
  - creeping shrubs had the lowest cooling performance
- it appears that succulent monocultures provide the largest benefits for substrate cooling, but a poor performance in terms of stormwater capture.

[@Lundholm2015] Lundholm. 2015. J Appl Ecol
- determine the impacts of green plant species  diversity on multiple ecosystem services
- experimental approach: monocultures, 9 species mixture,  and 15 species mixture
- used quantile regression to see if best-performing polycultures out-performed the best-performing monocultures for multiple services (stormwater capture, cooling, nutrient runoff, ecosystem multifunctionality)
- found that species richness was positively correlated with several services, including ecosystem multifunctionality
- four-year period: an increase in both trait-dependent complementarity and dominance

[@Lundholm2010] Lundholm et al. 2010. PLOS one
- examined if the impact of multiple vegetative life forms outperformed monocultures for several ecosystem services (e..g, stormwater capture, substrate cooling). 
- found that multiple life-forms within a single module had:
  - higher stormwater and substrate cooling than monocultures
  - indicating that a role of sampling effect or niche complementarity
- transpiration and water-uptake are two physiological processes that govern:
  - substrate cooling
  - stormwater retention 
- belowground spatial niche complementarity 
  - partially responsible for the two ecosystem services
  - selected species have variation in their root traits 
  - (e.g. dense and clustered fibrous roots versus rhizomes)

- ecological and evolutionary relevance of constructed ecosystems 
  - (e.g., green roofs, constructed wetlands, bioretention filters)
- defines constructed ecosystems “as a set of living and nonliving components”
  - designed to provide valuable services”
- distinctive features that separate constructed ecosystems:
  - (1) relatively simple designs
  - (2) small sizes
  - (3) ecological novelty (lack of historical evolutionary select pressures)
  - (4) the role of human design 
- socioeconomic factors play a role in the design of constructed ecosystems
  - such as the identity of the designer
  - ecologists can learn about community assembly from constructed ecosystems 
  - (e.g. start simple to more complex) 
  - no initial biological legacy to begin with
- evolutionary issues should exist in constructed ecosystem 
  - due to the relatively homogeneous conditions 
  - high levels of ecological novelty

[@Farrell2013] Farell et al. 2013. Plant Soil 
- habitat template approach to find high-water users with drought tolerance
- plant from granite outcrops were chosen as candidate species 
  - xerophytes adapted to limited-water conditions
  - geophytes will lose leaves in unfavourable conditions, but will remain alive
- for optimal performance, green roofs need to restore storage capacity as soon as possible
- tested physiological traits of 12 granite outcrop species in a glasshouse experiment 
- granite outcrop species outperform sedum succulents for stormwater runoff
- monocots and herbs had the highest transpiration rates due to high RMF
- but, mixtures with high drought-resistance and high stormwater performance is key

[@Szota2017] Szota et al. 2017. Sci Total Env
- selecting green roof plants has to balance both drought risk and stormwater retention
- “around 60-80% of rainfall is lost to evapotranspiration in natural ecosystems”
- green roofs should aim to achieve 80% rainfall lost to evapotranspiration
- stormwater retention is caused by different engineering components in the system
  - adding artificial components increase water retention, but adds extra weight 
  - green roof soil tend to have high hydraulic conductivity --> free-draining
- adding retention layers can help, but might be too heavy in some cases
- high water-users can restore storage capacity quickly, but can suffer from drought
  - drought avoiders - “isohydric”: tight stomatal regulation, maintain water status
  - drought-tolerant - “anisohydric”: decrease water status; but risks hydraulic failure
- natural ecosystems: drought-resistant plants develop extensive roots to acquire water
- but, may not work on green roofs due to limited water 
- some notes on methods:
  - Used previous climatic dataset to help simulate realistic rainfall events 
  - acquired crop coefficients as part of water balance model 
- main findings:
  - high crop factor (>1) increased water retention, but suffered from drought  
  - plants with crop factors (0.6 < k < 1) with drought avoidance --> ideal for balancing stormwater retention and drought risk

[@Zhang2018] Zhang et al. 2018. STOTEN ref

- tested green roof monoculture and mixtures on stormwater retention based on water-use strategies
- based in Australia (warm dry ecosystem); need to optimize rainfall retention and plant survival 
- plants needs to have high transpiration after rainfall and survive dry period
- biodiversity may improve retention through transgressive overyielding and selection effect
- life-form diversity is likely complicated by differences in biomass and rainfall interceptions
  - grass monocultures have higher retention than some life-form mixtures
  - possibility: unmeasured traits may affect retention
- used plants with different water-use strategies (plastic, conservative)
- green roofs captured at least 73% of rainfall
- retention was not always higher in mixtures than monocultures
  - affected by watering regime --> water-use strategies
- certain sedum species have poor ability to retain water
  - root systems create large pore channels that increased water flow in substrate
  - created a selection effect (i.e., high cover) and reduced water retention performance
